environmentally sensitive areas  trucks  ships  or barges transport the gas from a remote well to a pipeline or from a pipeline to a customer location  sometimes the gas is transported to remote filling stations for cng fueled vehicles  large scale transportation of cng is not yet commercialized but is considered economically feasible and is being pursued actively by several companies      history     in the     s  columbia natural gas of ohio tested a cng carrier  the ship was to carry compressed natural gas in vertical pressure bottles  however  this design failed because of the high cost of the pressure vessels  since then  there have been several attempts at developing a commercially viable cng carrier  in the past five years  several competing cng ocean transport designs have evolved  each design proposes a unique approach to optimizing gas transport while using as much off the shelf technology as possible to keep costs competitive      cng process     the cng chain consists of the following components    production  transportation  receiving  storage      production      the production facility for cng is simpler than other remote gas utilization options such as liquefied natural gas  lng   gas to liquid  gtl   ammonia  or methanol  it typically consists of compression  cooling  dehydration  and possibly liquefied petroleum gas  lpg  separation  the extent of compression and cooling is different for the various cng processes  the scope of the production facility depends on the quality of the gas and reservoir pressure  but is a small fraction of that of a comparably sized lng or gtl facility       transportation      a large portion of the cng carrier   s capital cost is the gas containment system and associated safety and gas control systems  the means for transporting cng differentiates the various cng processes that have emerged over the last few years  these processes include    coselle cng carrierstenning  d        the coselle cng carrier

concept        upstream    july    the central idea behind the coselle cng carrier  patented by cran and stenning technology inc   is to create a large but compact cng storage with a pipe  a coselle consists of several miles of small diameter pipe coiled into a carousel  hence the name coselle  enersea transport llc is commercializing the votrans technology  votrans consists of long  large diameter pipes encased in an insulated shell  the technology is different from other cng concepts in terms of the lower compression requirements because of lower pressure and temperature of storage  c natural gas   s cpl carrier uses a coiled pipeline configuration  which is easily adaptable to existing maritime shipping with nominal modifications to the off the shelf ship design  the pressure and temperature at which cng is stored vary depending on the cng process  a typical range of storage pressures is     to     bar       receiving      the cng ship unloads gas into a pipeline at the receiving station  the cng receiving terminal is relatively simple and includes a dock with high pressure pipeline connections and possibly an expander to allow energy to be recovered from the high pressure gas  a scavenging compressor may be needed to empty the ships below the pressure of the pipeline  this will make it possible to transport larger quantities of gas  which will reduce the number of ships required to transport a given quantity of gas       storage      storage at the production and receiving terminal is required to maintain continuous operation  assuming that the time between shipments is not great  a practical approach may be to have extra ships and keep them in the port for storage purposes      screening criteria     the volume reduction for cng depends on the conditions at which the compressed gas is stored but is typically in the range of     to      compared with gas at atmospheric conditions  cng is considered a viable transportation option for markets that are      km or less from the source of the gas  as the distance from the market increases  lng or gtl becomes more favorable assuming suffici

monitoring how it operates is very difficult  additionally  it is also difficult to find sensors and electronics that operate reliably and long term under the range of downhole conditions required  the esp   s reliability or run life is directly related to the continual monitoring of its operating parameters and the wellbore conditions  not only is this information critical to the run life  but it is also important for the evaluation of the application design of the esp system in the hole  this evaluation can provide guidance on possible operational changes that can be made to optimize the current system or the esp design changes needed to optimize the application  if esp systems were fully instrumented and continuous monitoring systems employed  improvements in run life and operational performance would be improved significantly  but  to do this  the wellbore economics has to support it   sensors are available for mounting internally in the esp components or externally as an attachment to the system  the signals from these sensors are communicated to the surface readout module by a separate instrument wire   quot i quot  wire  or by a signal imposed on one leg of the esp power cable   typically  the standard esp application only provides the opportunity to monitor surface parameters  such as three phase amps and volts  wellhead pressure  and  to a limited extent  flow

intake or casing annulus pressure      this information provides wellbore static pressure and the well flowing pressure at the production rate  if the measurement is sensitive enough  it can also provide excellent well drawdown information       internal motor temperature      this measurement is critical not only to the protection of the motor but also in selecting the correct motor hp rating and lubricating oil for the application  if a loaded motor is running close to its maximum temperature rating  some operational steps could be implemented to reduce its load and temperature  also  the next unit in the hole could be derated or sized with a larger motor to run underloaded  likewise  if the motor is running cool  there are future opportunities to install a smaller motor  additionally  sudden temperature spikes or long term gradual changes are an indication of changing equipment performance or wellbore conditions  which may need evaluation       pump discharge pressure      this parameter provides a reading on the discharge pressure of the pump  this reading and the pump intake pressure provide a measurement of the total developed head  tdh  of the pump  comparing this value to the design tdh  hydraulic performance of the pump can be monitored and continually evaluated  additionally  for gassy and or viscous fluids  pump performance correction factors can be established or verified for that particular wellbore condition       pump discharge temperature      this measurement provides the temperature of the discharge fluid from the pump  the production fluid is heated as a result of the heat rejected by the motor and pump inefficiencies  the fluid heat rise through the pump can be used to calculate the fluid volumetric increase and the viscosity change of the fluid  once again  sudden spikes or longer term changes can provide warnings of potential problems       downhole flow rate      downhole flowmeters are available that provide flow rate measurements from the pump discharge  this is an excellent tool  when compared to the surface flow rate  for evaluating esp performance and warning of potential problems  because surface flow rate is not generally continuously monitored  this can be a piece of information for enhanced esp protection  in multiphase fluid  gassy  applications  the selection and calibration of the flowmeter is important because of the difficulty in accurately measuring this fluid       equipment vibration      there have been several applications that have used downhole vibration sensors  unless there is a sudden step change in the measurement  this parameter is difficult to evaluate  there is a possibility that  with more case histories  this can become a good evaluation tool      esp packers     typically  esp packers are

permeability can then decrease by orders of magnitude  as effective pressure is increased  pore space decreases and permeability is lowered  the change in permeability with pressure is greater at low

send the power fluid downhole  a gas  diesel or electric engine to drive the pump  and a system for storing  treating and delivering the power fluid  produced oil or water  for use by the downhole pump  this page discusses some of the key surface components of the system      surface pumps     hydraulic pumping systems have evolved toward the use of relatively high pressures and low flow rates to reduce friction losses and to increase the lift capability and efficiency of the system  surface operating pressures are generally between       and       psi  with the higher pressures used in deeper wells  and power fluid rates may range from a few hundred to more than       b d  while some surface multistage centrifugal pumps are rated to this pressure range  they are generally quite inefficient at the modest flow rates associated with single well applications  multistage centrifugals can be used effectively when multiple wells are pumped from a central location   the surface pump for a single well or for just a few wells must be a high head and low specific speed pump  wide experience in the overall pumping industry has led to the use of positive displacement pumps for this type of application  and triplex or quintuplex pumps  driven by gas engines or electric motors  power the vast majority of hydraulic pump installations  see    fig          file vol  page     image      png    fig    horizontal plunger pumps       back to top  multiplex pumps consist of a power end and a fluid end  the power end houses a crankshaft in a crankcase  the connecting rods are similar to those in internal combustion engines  but connect to crossheads instead of pistons  the fluid end houses individual plungers  each with intake and discharge check valves usually spring loaded  and is attached to the power end by the spacer block  which houses the intermediate rods and provides a working space for access to the plunger system  most units being installed in the oil field are of the horizontal configuration  which minimizes contamination of the crankcase oil with leakage from the fluid end  vertical installations are still found  however  particularly with oil as the pumped fluid or when space is at a premium  as in townsite leases   multiplex pumps applied to hydraulic pumping usually have stroke lengths from   to   in  and plunger diameters between   and     in  the larger plungers provide higher flow rates but are generally rated at lower maximum pressure because of crankshaft loading limitations  the normal maximum rating of multiplexes for continuous duty in hydraulic pumping applications is       psi  with lower ratings for the larger plungers  but applications above       psi are uncommon  multiplex pumps are run at low speed to minimize vibration and wear and to avoid dynamic problems with the spring loaded intake and discharge valves  most applications fall between     and     rev min  and because this is below the speeds of gas engines or electric motors  some form of speed reduction is usually required  belt drives are found on some units  although gear reduction is more common while gear reduction units are integral to some multiplexes and separate on others  a variety of reduction ratios are offered for each series of pumps  because a positive displacement pump has an essentially constant discharge flow rate for a given prime mover speed  bypass of excess fluid normally is used to match a particular pressure and flow demand  another option that has been used successfully is to drive the multiplex pump through a four speed transmission  which greatly enhances the flexibility of the system  this allows much closer tailoring of the triplex output to the demand  thereby pumping at reduced speed when needed  which also tends to increase the life of such components as the packing and valving   each plunger pumps individually from a common intake manifold into a common discharge  and because discharge occurs only on the upstroke  there is some pulsation  for which pulsation dampers are commonly used   back to top  two types of plunger systems are in common use  for oil service  a simple and effective plunger and liner system is used that consists of a closely fitted metallic plunger inside a metallic liner  sprayed metal coatings or other hard facing means are often used to extend the life of the plunger and liner  when pumping water  the metal to metal system is not practical because the fit would have to be extremely close to keep leakage to an acceptable level  galling and scoring are problems with close fits and the low lubricity of water  and to solve this problem  spring loaded packing systems are used that do not require adjusting  the advent of high strength aramid fibers for packing  in conjunction with other compounds to improve the friction characteristics  has resulted in a pronounced improvement in

differences  first  the expansivity terms in the balance of mass equations depend on the pressures both inside and outside the pipe  for instance  increased annulus pressure can decrease the cross sectional area inside the pipe  and increased pipe pressure can increase the cross sectional area because of pipe elastic deformation  the second major difference is the effect of pipe speed on the

and between the aquifer and reservoir  as pressure depletion proceeds  the pressure difference between the reservoir and aquifer grows rapidly and then abates as the aquifer and reservoir eventually equilibrate  this pressure interaction causes the water influx rate to start at zero  grow steadily  reach a maximum  and then dissipate  this particular water influx rate history behavior applies to initially saturated oil reservoirs  the behavior for initially undersaturated oil reservoirs is often slightly but distinctly different  the effects of undersaturation on the water influx performance

density logging tools rely on gamma gamma scattering or on photoelectric  pe  absorption      density logging tools     a density logging tool sends gamma rays into a formation and detects those that are scattered back  typical logging sondes use a cesium     source  which emits gamma rays of     mev  at this high energy level  compton scattering dominates  the average electron density in the volume of formation probed by the tool controls the scattered gamma ray count rates at the detectors  as we saw above  average electron density  in turn  correlates strongly  but not perfectly  with bulk density  because the gamma rays cannot penetrate far into the formation  the volume of investigation is small  mudcake and tool standoff have particularly strong effects on this measurement  for less energetic gamma rays  photoelectric  pe  absorption controls the observed count rates  here  the average atomic number  which correlates with rock type  sets the amount of pe absorption that a formation exhibits  again  all the bulk average effects accrue  with special problems posed by barium weighted mud   the depth of investigation of a density tool decreases with increasing density and never exceeds   in   as the pseudogeometric factor in    fig       shows  the log almost always measures the invaded zone  at least in porous  permeable formations  as is typical of the nuclear scattering family of measurements  the density tool uses two detectors at progressively longer distances from the source  the distance between the near and far detectors sets the vertical resolution  approximately    in  typically  correction is by the spine and ribs technique  the spine is the normal calibrated relationship between the density measured by the near spaced and far spaced detectors in the absence of any gap between the tool and the borehole wall  gaps cause departures from this spine and lead to density corrections that are applied to the density from the long space detector  this correction is presented as a curve with the density log  above an inch or so of standoff  the compensation fails  there is no universal correction threshold  but corrections greater than      to     g cm  are suspicious  unfortunately  a low correction does not guarantee a good measurement  connecting a particular rib back to the correct location on the spine  and  hence  to the correct bulk density  requires that the density pad be parallel to the borehole wall  likewise  very small water filled gaps can give rise to large corrections that are perfectly correct    file vol  page

  in the standard sequential interpretation process  the analyst determines porosity directly from the density log  it is conceptually the easiest of the porosity logs to interpret because  if ever a tool obeyed a linear bulk mixing law  it is the density logs   in a simple clean reservoir  the interpretation model is   rtenotitle                         solved for porosity  this yields  rtenotitle                         this porosity is subscripted with a t for total porosity because it draws no distinction between pore fluid and fluid possibly bound in shales  as mentioned in the general interpretation discussion  the density log rarely sees past the invaded zone  so       fl           mf    the mud filtrate density  even if shale is present  the interpretation merely requires an additional term   rtenotitle                         and the corresponding shale correction to turn total porosity into effective porosity is straightforward  again  more sophisticated formation descriptions require more parameters  which in turn require more measured data for calibration   in known lithology  the grain density        ma  can be chosen from a table like    table       sensitivity can be analyzed directly by taking the partial derivative of the response equation with respect to grain density  for a    p u   water filled sandstone  an error of      g cm  in the supposed grain density will only alter the calculated porosity by   p u  a similar analysis of the sensitivity to fluid density shows that a variation of more than     g cm   in the fluid density corresponds to a similar   p u  error in the calculated porosity   this is fortunate because fluid density within the density tool   s volume of investigation may be very difficult to estimate  as already discussed  because of its shallow depth of investigation  the density log is commonly a flushed zone device  and the fluid density that it sees may be taken to be that of the mud filtrate  the effect of a small amount of immovable hydrocarbon or connate water can  more often than not  be ignored  if gas is present  its lo

property region consisting of fine grid cells with an equivalent homogeneous region made up of a single coarse grid cell with an effective property value   equivalent in this case means either volume or flux vice  depending on the type of property that is to be upscaled    upscaling is performed for each of the cells in the coarse grid and for each of the grid properties needed in the reservoir flow simulation model  therefore  the upscaling process is essentially an averaging procedure in which the static and dynamic characteristics of a fine scale model are to be approximated by that of a coarse scale model  a conceptual illustration of the upscaling process is shown in    fig          file vol  page      image      png    fig        concept of upscaling          can upscaling be avoided      typically   d geological models contain detailed descriptions of the reservoir that can be hard to capture properly with a significantly coarser model  therefore  it would be preferable if upscaling could be avoided  currently  an average sized flow simulation model consists of approximately         active grid cells  this is to ensure that the cpu consumption of a simulation run will be reasonable  i e   within practical limits    because a typical  d geological model may consist of approximately    million active grid cells  it is obviously infeasible to run fluid flow simulations directly on the geological model  hence  upscaling is a required part of current reservoir modeling workflows   seen through the eyes of the geologist  the upscaling task may be a painful experience because all the geological details that were put into the model seem to be lost in the process  for a reservoir engineer  on the other hand  effective properties might be all that matter   for volumetric  additive  properties such as porosity and saturation  the effective flow cell value is simply given by the bulk and pore volume weighted arithmetic average  respectively  of the geo cells inside it  for the permeability  which is intrinsic  nonadditive  by nature  no such simple averaging method exists  the complexity one needs to take into account when upscaling permeability is considerable  therefore  all current techniques provide only an approximation of the true effective cell permeability  this approximation may range from very good to very poor  depending on the complexity of the fine scale permeability distribution as well as the upscaling method used      upscaling techniques for absolute permeability     homogenization of absolute permeability does not have an exact analytical solution  except for in a few idealized cases  the challenge of computing an accurate effective permeability has resulted in a large number of upscaling techniques  these techniques range from simple statistical averages to advanced numerical methods   tensor methods are the most accurate techniques available for computing the effective cell permeability  these are based on solving a second order elliptic differential equation describing single phase  incompressible  steady state fluid flow in a region without sources and sinks  i e   wells   some flow based methods may provide a   full   permeability tensor  however  because most multiphase flow simulators can only handle a diagonal permeability tensor because of the use of a seven point stencil in  d  diagonal tensor methods are most frequently used whether directly or indirectly  through a diagonalization of a full tensor   for a diagonal tensor  only the effective permeability in the principal directions of flow    x      y    and   z    will be nonzero   the flow equation is usually discretized with a finite difference scheme  although finite element methods are also applied occasionally  to compute all the directional components of the permeability tensor  the discretization and solution of the flow equation must be performed for each of the principal flow directions  i e   three separate single phase simulations need to be performed   each simulation involves the iterative solution of a linear equation system  typically  the linear solver is a conjugate gradient method  preconditioned by incomplete cholesky or lu factorization   the unknowns in this equation system are the geo cell pressures inside the flow cell  whereas known quantities are the geo cell dimensions and permeabilities  as well as the pressure conditions along the faces of the flow cell  when the numerical solution of the fine scale pressure distribution has converged  an effective permeability is computed by equating expressions for the flux through the heterogeneous geo cells with the flux through the equivalent homogeneous flow cell using some form of darcy   s law   the pressure field is usually solved locally   that is  for one flow cell at a time  however  the size of the   computational   region may not necessarily be

petroleum corp  in the hugoton field gidley  j l   holditch  s a   nierode  d e  et al        an overview of hydraulic fracturing  in recent advances in hydraulic fracturing      chap           richardson  texas  monograph series  spe  kelpper well no     located in grant county  kansas  was a low productivity well  even though it had been acidized  the well was chosen for the first hydraulic fracture stimulation treatment so that hydraulic fracturing could be compared directly with acidizing  since that first treatment in       hydraulic fracturing has become a common treatment for stimulating the productivity of oil and gas wells      overview     hydraulic fracturing is the process of pumping fluid into a wellbore at an injection rate that is too high for the formation to accept without breaking  during injection the resistance to flow in the formation increases  the pressure in the wellbore increases to a value called the break down pressure  that is the sum of the in situ compressive stress and the strength of the formation  once the formation    breaks down     a fracture is formed  and the injected fluid flows through it  from a limited group of active perforations  ideally a single  vertical fracture is created that propagates in two  quot wings quot  being       apart and identical in shape and size  in naturally fractured or cleated formations  it is possible that multiple fractures are created and or the two wings evolve in a tree like pattern with increasing number of branches away from the injection point   fluid not containing any solid  called the    pad     is injected first  until the fracture is wide enough to accept a propping agent  the purpose of the propping agent is to keep apart the fracture surfaces once the pumping operation ceases  the pressure in the fracture decreases bellow the compressive in situ stress trying to close the fracture  in deep reservoirs  man made ceramic beads are used to hold open or    prop    the fracture  in shallow reservoirs  sand is normally used as the propping agent      objectives     in general  hydraulic fracture treatments are used to increase the productivity index of a producing well or the injectivity index of an injection well  the productivity index defines the rate at which oil or gas can be produced at a given pressure differential between the reservoir and the wellbore  while the injectivity index refers to the rate at which fluid can be injected into a well at a given pressure differential   there are many applications for hydraulic fracturing  hydraulic fracturing can    increase the flow rate of oil and or gas from low permeability reservoirs  increase the flow rate of oil and or gas from wells that have been damaged  connect the natural fractures and or cleats in a formation to the wellbore  decrease the pressure drop around the well to minimize sand production  enhance gravel packing sand placement  decrease the pressure drop around the well to minimize problems with asphaltine and or paraffin deposition  increase the area of drainage or the amount of formation in contact with the wellbore  connect the full vertical extent of a reservoir to a slanted or horizontal well   there could be other uses  but most of the treatments are pumped for these reasons   a low permeability reservoir is one that has a high resistance to fluid flow  in many formations  chemical and or physical processes alter the reservoir rock over geologic time  sometimes  these diagenetic processes restrict the openings in the rock and reduce the ability of fluids to flow through the rock  low permeability rocks are normally excellent candidates for stimulation by hydraulic fracturing   regardless of the permeability  a reservoir rock can be damaged when a well is drilled through the reservoir and when casing is set and cemented in place  damage occurs  because drilling and or completion fluids leak into the reservoir and alter the pores and pore throats  when the pores are plugged  the permeability is reduced  and the fluid flow in this damaged portion of the reservoir may be substantially reduced  damage can be especially severe in naturally fractured reservoirs  to stimulate damaged reservoirs  a short  conductive hydraulic fracture is often the desired solution   in many cases  especially for low permeability formations  damaged reservoirs  or horizontal wells in a layered reservoir  the well would be uneconomical unless a successful hydraulic fracture treatment is designed and pumped  the engineer in charge of the economic success of such a well must design the optimal fracture treatment and then go to the field to be certain the optimal treatment is pumped successfully      candidate selection     the success or failure of a hydraulic fracture treatment often depends on the quality of the candidate well selected for the treatment  choosing an ex

classification these materials include    pozzolanic portland cements  pozzolan lime cements  resin or plastic cements  gypsum cements  microfine cements  expanding cements  refractory cements  latex cements  cements for permafrost environments  sorel cements  cements for carbon dioxide  co   resistance     pozzolanic cements     pozzolanic materials include any natural or industrial siliceous or silico aluminous material  which will combine with lime in the presence of water at ordinary temperatures to produce strength developing insoluble compounds similar to those formed from hydration of portland cement  typically  pozzolanic material is categorized as natural or artificial  and can be either processed or unprocessed  the most common sources of natural pozzolanic materials are volcanic materials and diatomaceous earth  de   artificial pozzolanic materials are produced by partially calcining natural materials such as clays  shales  and certain siliceous rocks  or are more usually obtained as an industrial byproduct  artificial pozzolanic materials include    metakaolin  fly ash  microsilica  silica fume   ground granulated blast furnace slag  pozzolanic oilwell cements are typically used to produce lightweight slurries  because the specific gravity of the pozzolanic material is lower than that of the cement  a pozzolan slurry has a lighter weight than a corresponding portland cement slurry of similar consistency  the lighter weight keeps the formation from breaking down  it is important not to exceed the fracture pressure of the formation while cementing   some pozzolanic materials also have a high water demand that effectively gives a higher yield and lighter slurry  they also tend to improve compressive strength over time  the additional binding material also reduces permeability and minimizes attack from formation waters  in most cases  pozzolanic materials can also reduce the effect of sulfate attack  though this is to a certain degree dependent on the slurry design   commercial cements such as txi lightweight    for use in oil wells are a special formulation composed of portland cement clinker interground with lightweight siliceous aggregate to produce  in effect  a pozzolanic cement      pozzolan line cements     pozzolan lime or silica lime cements are usually blends of fly ash  silica   hydrated lime  and small quantities of calcium chloride  at low temperatures  the initial reactions of these cements are slower than similar reactions in portland cements  and they are generally recommended for primary cementing at temperatures greater than      c       f   the merits of this type of cement are    ease of retardation  light weight  economy  strength stability at high temperatures     gypsum cements     gypsum cement is a blend of api class a  c  g  or h cement and a hemihydrate form of gypsum  caso       h o   gypsum cements are commonly used in low temperature applications for primary cementing or remedial cementing work  this combination is particularly useful in shallow wells to minimize fallback after placement  a high gypsum content cement has increased ductility  thixotropy  and acid solubility  it is usually used in situations of high lateral stress  or in temporary plugging applications  a       gypsum cement is frequently used in fighting lost circulation  to form a permanent insoluble plugging material  these blends should be used cautiously  because they have very rapid setting properties  and could set prematurely during placement  a limitation of gypsum cements is that they are slowly soluble  and they are not stable in contact with external sources of water  this would be a fatal error for an oilfield cement      microfine cements     microfine cements are composed of    very finely ground sulfate resisting portland cements  portland cement blends with ground granulated blast furnace slag  alkali activated ground granulated blast furnace slag  such cements have a high penetrability and are ultrarapid hardening  applications for such cements are in consolidation of unsound formations  and in repairing casing leaks in squeeze operations  particularly    tight    leaks that are inaccessible to conventional cement slurries because of their penetrability  ultrafine alkali activated ground blast furnace slag is the product used in the mud to cement technology  in which water based drilling mud is converted to cement      expanding cements     expansive cements are available for the primary purpose of improving the bond of cement to pipe and formation  if expansion is properly restrained  its magnitude will be reduced and a pre stress will develop  expansion can also be used to compensate for the effects of shrinkage in normal portland cement   at this time  there is no test procedure or specifications in the api standards for measuring the expansion forces in cement  most

interacting components  gilbertgilbert  w e        flowing and gas lift well performance  drill   amp  prod  prac           dallas  texas  api  was perhaps the first to introduce the approach to oil and gas wells but mach  proano  and brownmach  j   proano  e   and brown  k e        a nodal approach for applying systems analysis to the flowing and artificial lift oil or gas well  paper spe      available from spe  richardson  texas  and brownbrown  k e        the technology of artificial lift methods     tulsa  oklahoma  pennwell publishing co  popularized the concept  which is typically referred to as nodal analysis    within the oil and gas industry  the objective of systems analysis is to combine the various components of the production system for an individual well to estimate production rates and optimize the components of the production system      necessity of examining flow through system     the flow of reservoir fluids from the subsurface reservoir to the stock tank or sales line requires an understanding of the principles of fluid flow through porous media and well tubulars  as the fluid moves through the production system  there will be an associated pressure drop to accompany the fluid flow  this pressure drop will be the sum of the pressure drops through the various components in the production system  because of the compressible nature of the fluids produced in oil and gas operations  the pressure drop is dependent on the interaction between the various components in the system  this occurs because the pressure drop in a particular component is not only dependent on the flow rate through the component  but also on the average pressure that exists in the component   as a result  the final design of a production system requires an integrated approach  since the system cannot be separated into a reservoir component or a piping component and handled independently  the amount of oil and gas produced from the reservoir to the surface depends on the total pressure drop in the production system  and the pressure drop in the system depends on the amount of fluid flowing through the system  consequently  the entire production system must be analyzed as a unit or system   depending on the terminal end of the production system  there is a total pressure drop from the reservoir pressure to the surface  as depicted in    fig        if the separator represents the end of the production system  the total pressure drop in the system is the difference between the average reservoir pressure and the separator pressure    file vol  page     image      png    fig      production system and associated pressure losses       rtenotitle                         this total pressure drop is then composed of individual pressure drops as the reservoir fluid flows to the surface  these pressure drops occur as the fluid flows through the reservoir and well completion  up the tubing  through the wellhead equipment and choke  and through the surface flowlines to the separator  thus  the total pressure drop of    eq       can be represented by    eq         rtenotitle                         these individual pressure drops can be divided into yet additional pressure drops to account for restrictions  subsurface safety valves  tubing accessories  etc   systems analysis is based on the concept of continuity  at any given point in the production system  there is a particular pressure and production rate associated with that point for a set of conditions  if there is any change in the system  then there will be an associated change in pressure and or production rate at that same point  this concept allows the production system to be divided at a point of interest for evaluation of the two portions of the system  this evaluation determines the conditions of continuity of pressure and production rate at the division point  which is the estimated producing condition for the system being evaluated   the approach provides the flexibility to divide the production system at any point of interest within the system to evaluate a particular component of the system  the most common division points are at the wellhead or at the perforations  either at the reservoir sandface or inside the wellbore  the terminal ends of the system will be the reservoir on the upstream end of the system and the separator at the downstream end of the system or the wellhead if a wellhead choke controls the well   the components upstream of the division point or node comprise the inflow section of the system  while the components downstream of the node represent the outflow section  once the system is divided into inflow and outflow sections  relationships are written to describe the rate pressure relationship within each section  the flow rate through the system is determined once the conditions of continuity are satisfied    flow into the divisio

may lose our investment  we may make a handsome profit  we are in a risky business  assessing the outcomes  assigning probabilities of occurrence and associated values  is how we analyze and prepare to manage risk   risk and decision analysis software is as diverse as the analysis methods themselves  there are programs to do monte carlo simulation and decision tree analysis  analytic models to do economics can be linked to both monte carlo simulation and decision trees  closely related are optimization  sensitivity analysis  and influence diagrams  extending further  we encounter forecasting  expert systems  and fuzzy logic  within geoscientists    purview are mapping packages and geostatistics software  both of which have the potential to offer strong support to the analysis of

 undergraduate engineering programs sometimes include one course in statistics  and graduate programs often require one  unfortunately  what engineers take away from those classes does not always prepare them to deal with uncertainty analysis  for whatever reason  engineers do not gain a level of comfort with the language nor see immediate use for it in their jobs   statistical concepts in risk analysis introduces the concepts of    central tendency  mean  mode  and median   dispersion  standard deviation  ranges  and confidence intervals   skewness  the graphical tools  histograms  density functions  and cumulative distributions  necessary to communicate ideas of uncertainty about a single variable  correlation and regression  especially the former  serve to describe the relationship between two parameters  we use excel to illustrate these descriptive statistics   this section clarifies what it means to fit historical data  the premise is that we usually have a small sample taken from a huge population  which we wish to describe  the process begins by constructing a histogram from the data and then seeking a density function that resembles the histogram  this statistical tool contrasts sharply with the well known linear regression  in spite of the fact that their metrics to judge the goodness of fit appear similar   three common distribution types   normal  log normal  and binomial   are discussed at length to assist users in choosing an appropriate type when building a model  the central limit theorem establishes guidelines about sums and products of distributions  a cousin of statistics  probability theory  paves the way to introduce bayes    theorem  which is invoked in prospect evaluation to ensure consistent logic for revising probabilities      the tools of the trade     monte carlo simulation and decision trees are defined and illustrated  compared and contrasted  some problems yield to one or the other of these tools  occasionally  both methods can serve a useful purpose  decision trees are visual  their impact diminishes as the model becomes larger and more complex  decision trees rely on expected value  but decision makers do not always do the same  which brings about the notion of utility functions  decision trees have their unique form of sensitivity analysis  limited to tweaking one or two variables at a time  solutions to decision trees consist of a recommended path or choice of action and an associated expected value   monte carlo models do not result in a recommended course of action  rather they make estimates  providing ranges rather than single values like deterministic models  their scope is broad  ranging from simple estimates of oil and or gas reserves with volumetric formulas to full scale field development  these models and the subsequent analysis and presentation show the wide range of possible outcomes and the probability of each   additional tools such as optimization and options may also be useful   among the issues raised by practitioners of risk analysis are    why should we be doing this     and    now that we are doing it  are we doing it right     both of these questions are addressed by identifying pitfalls of deterministic models  to see why we should migrate toward probabilistic methods  and pitfalls of probabilistic models  to see how we might go astray here

operations for overboard disposal or injection into a disposal well  but when onshore  it is treated for surface disposal  liquid injection  or steam injection  in all instances  the produced water must be cleaned of dispersed and dissolved oil and solids to a level suitable for environmental  reservoir  or steam generation purposes  surface water is treated offshore for liquid injection and onshore for liquid  or steam injection purposes  in all instances  the surface water must be cleaned of dispersed and dissolved solids to a level suitable for reservoir or steam generation purposes in oil producing operations  it is often desirable to inject water or steam into the formation to improve oil recovery  water injection for this purpose is called a waterflood  when properly implemented  it will maintain reservoir pressure and significantly improve the oil recovery vs  primary production  steam injection  known as a steamflood  will reduce the viscosity of oil and further enhance the oil recovery  see the chapter on steam injection in the reservoir engineering and petrophysics volume of this   handbook   in offshore areas  governing regulations specify the maximum hydrocarbon and solids content in the water allowed in overboard discharges  some studies have estimated that during the life of a well    to   bbl of water are produced for every barrel of oil  making this fluid the

this chapter discusses the equipment and design criteria used in common water treatment systems for disposal or injection  in addition to the removal of dispersed or dissolved hydrocarbons and solids  the water treatment engineer may be concerned with chemical treatment  material selection  and solids disposal  which are also covered __toc__     produced water discharge or  steam  injection         separating free hydrocarbons from water      produced water typically enters the water treatment system from a two  or three phase separator  free water knockout  gun barrel  heater treater  or other primary separation unit process  this water contains small concentrations      to      mg l  of dispersed hydrocarbons in the form of oil droplets  because the water flows from this equipment through dump valves  control valves  chokes  or pumps  the oil particle diameters will be very small       theory       treatment equipment to remove dispersed oil from water relies on one or more of the following principles  gravity separation  often with the addition of coalescing devices   gas flotation  cyclonic separation  filtration  and centrifuge separation  in applying these concepts  one must keep in mind the dispersion of large oil droplets to smaller ones and the coalescence of small droplets into larger ones  which takes place if energy is added to the system  the amount of energy added per unit time and the way in which it is added will determine whether dispersion or coalescence will take place      gravity separation       stokes    law  shown in    eq          is valid for the buoyant rise velocity of an oil droplet in a water continuous phase rtenotitle                         where   v     velocity of the droplet or particle rising or settling in a continuous phase

velocity  that is  the bigger the droplet size  the less time it takes to rise to a collection surface and  thus  the easier it is to treat the water   the greater the difference in density between the oil droplet and the water phase  the greater the vertical velocity  that is  the lighter the crude  the easier it is to treat the water   the higher the temperature  the lower the viscosity of the water and  thus  the greater the vertical velocity  that is  it is easier to treat the water at high temperatures than at low temperatures   increasing the g force imposed on the fluid  i e   by

drawbacks and skeptics  despite its    year history of use in the industry      history     the first recorded use of air drilling was in the early     s  a piston type compressed air mechanical drill

fig        air drilling techniques          dust drilling      dust drilling is another term for air drilling  compressed air is the sole circulating medium  because no fluid is injected  the annular returns are    dust     dust drilling provides an ideal environment for use with air hammers  is the least expensive type of air drilling  requires no fluid system for cleanup  provides maximum penetration rates  and extends drill bit life  however  dust drilling cannot effectively handle wellbore fluid influxes  those influxes will wet cuttings and result in mud rings in the annulus  and there is a risk of a down hole fire if mud rings are not eliminated  switching to mist or foam drilling would allow continued air drilling in the presence of water  diamond air drilling service    introduction to air drilling    slideshow presentation         mist drilling      mist drilling is air drilling with liquids  generally water  soap  and chemical inhibitors  the water and soap mixture is added to the air stream at the drilling surface at a controlled rate to improve annular hole cleaning  many different mediums can be used for mist drilling  water  surfactants  etc   the annular pressure increases in mist drilling  so the rate of penetration will usually be lower than in dust drilling  in mist drilling  the rate of penetration is higher than in conventional mud drilling  drilling can proceed while producing fluids  hold cleaning capacity improves  risk of downhole fires decreases  and no nitrogen is needed  but the penetration rate is still slower than in dust drilling and water influx makes misting uneconomical  if large liquid influxes are encountered  foam or aerated mud drilling are more viable options  diamond air drilling service    introduction to air drilling    slideshow presentation         foam drilling      in foam drilling  water  surfactants  and air are combined to create a stiff foam  the foam is then circulated as a drilling fluid  the cuttings carrying capacity is     times greater than dust drilling  and the required annular velocity for optimum hole cleaning is significantly lower  the lower air volume equals less air equipment is required than in dust or mist drilling  holding back pressure on the annulus can reduce water influx and or maintain hole wall stability  but foam drilling has its drawbacks  surface requirements  or pits  for foam can become a problem  large pits must be built to contain foam and allow time for the foam to settle  the cost of chemicals to break down foam can be high  a large influx of fluids can break down the foam  reducing hole cleaning  diamond air drilling service    introduction to air drilling    slideshow presentation         aerated drilling      air or nitrogen is added to the liquid phase of the drilling fluid  lowering the effective mud weight  in aerated drilling  the air or nitrogen is injected directly into the standpipe  using parasite string  or using concentric casing strings  corrosion inhibitors are highly recommended in this method  nitrogen must be used with oil based mud or when working with a closed loop system  closed separator   and it is

discusses a few of these environments and how gas lift is used in the particular application      offshore platforms     gas lift is a widely used artificial lift system in offshore installations and has performed exceptionally well  most downhole gas lift equipment has few if any moving parts and requires little maintenance  what little maintenance that is required can normally be done with wireline equipment  for this reason  downhole gas lift equipment is much less costly to replace than other forms of downhole artificial lift equipment  the required space  or  quot footprint  quot  and weight of gas lift surface controls are minimal  because produced gas from the offshore wells generally must be conserved  it can be compressed and provide a ready source of high pressure gas for gas lift   the process of gas lift from offshore platforms is slightly different from gas lift onshore  in many cases  the surface installations on offshore platforms are better designed than onshore installations  if designed properly  there will be very little pressure loss caused by restrictions or flowlines  the compressors for gas lift are located nearby  so the distribution of gas should be no problem  because of the importance to the overall installation  gas compression and dehydration equipment is normally operated and maintained by people who are provided for this specific purpose       safety devices      there are many more safety devices on offshore platforms than on onshore installations  high  low pressure shutoff devices are installed at the wellhead on both the injection gas line and the flowline to automatically close in the well at the surface  should there be a radical change in either line   s operating pressure   surface or downhole safety devices are a necessary part of any offshore well  with so much property and human life at stake on the platforms  it is an absolute necessity to prevent downhole or surface catastrophic failure  safety valves are included on the production string of a gas lift well and may cause some restriction to flow  in the north sea  governmental agencies also require a safety valve on the gas injection side of gas lift wells  the reason is the possibility of the check valve on the gas lift valve failing  which would allow well fluids to flow into the casing  restrictions from subsurface safety equipment may enter into the design of a gas lift installation       gas lift installations drilled from offshore platforms      wells drilled from offshore platforms have varying degrees of deviation that must be accounted for in predicting vertical multiphase flow  most gas lift design programs can take this varying deviation into account  wireline operators report little problems in setting valves in mandrels at deviations up to       motors have been developed to move tools downhole at high deviations and have been used in some instances  the gas lift retrievable valve mandrels with orientation sleeves are designed to insure that the valve enters the pocket regardless of pocket orientation relative to the vertical      subsea gas lift installations     subsea installations increased dramatically in the last few years with the addition of producing areas in greater and greater water depths  today  it is not unusual to find production from water depths over       ft with gas lift being the preferred production method in most of these completions  with extreme water depths  some form of artificial lift is usually required just to kick off the well and move the production from the seafloor to the surface   devices and equipment for carrying gas lift equipment into subsea wells were perfected at the onset of subsea technology  these include devices for carrying the valves and engines for driving the valve downhole through flowlines and other systems  poettmann  f h  and carpenter  p g        the multiphase flow of gas  oil and water through vertical flow strings  drilling  amp  prod  prac       although such tools are available  these operational techniques are not widely used  most subsea gas lift today is done with high pressure gas and a single orifice placed as deep as the pressure will permit  by using this approach  there is no gas lift equipment in the well that could fail or need replacing  in many deepwater installations  where the water depth itself adds considerable head that must be overcome to produce the well  gas injection is often through a single point at the wellhead or near the mudline  noonan  s  and decker  k        subsea gas lift design

elastomer and often result from chemical or physical elastomer breakdown induced by the wellbore environment      overview     the environment can vary considerably between different reservoirs and individual operations    the bottomhole temperature may range from    to      c     to      f   the well may be pumped off or have a high bottomhole pressure  the produced fluids may contain solids  e g   sand  coal fines   gases  e g   ch   co   h s   and a wide range of other constituents  including      water   paraffins   naphthenes   asphaltenes   aromatics  additionally  the methods and fluids used to drill  treat  and stimulate wells introduce a variety of other chemicals into the wellbore  such as    drilling muds  completion fluids  heavy salt solutions   treatment fluids  e g   diluents  hot oil  strong acids   corrosion inhibitors  e g   amines   flooding materials  e g   co    successful use of pc pumps  particularly in the more severe downhole environments  requires proper elastomer selection and appropriate pump sizing and operation  pc pump manufacturers continue to develop and test new elastomers  over time  these efforts have resulted in performance improvements and an expanded range of practical applications  despite this success  the elastomer component still continues to impose severe restrictions on pc pump use  especially in applications with lighter oils or higher temperatures      mechanical and chemical croperties     the performance of an elastomer in a pcp application depends heavily on its mechanical and chemical properties gent  a n        engineering with rubber  new york city  oxford university press morton  m        rubber technology  third edition  london  chapman and hall  although many different mechanical properties can be quantified for elastomers  only a few are highly relevant to pc pump performance  one important property is hardness because it characterizes the relationship between the rotor stator interference fit and the resulting sealing force  tear strength is also important because it provides a measure of an elastomer   s resistance to tearing and indicates its fatigue and abrasion resistance  although abrasion resistance is a critical parameter in many applications  the american society for testing and materials  astm  abrasion tests  drum  tabor  pico  do not represent the pc pump wear mode and should be interpreted with caution  dynamic properties  which characterize the hysteretic heat buildup behavior  are not overly critical in pc pumps because the flexing frequencies of the single lobe geometries are generally not high enough to result in significant temperature rise  except when the fit is very tight or heat removal is minimal  although tensile strength and elongation are commonly referenced properties  they have little practical relevance to pc pumps other than their relationship to other mechanical properties because the elastomer is strained to only a fraction of its capacity     table      summarizes the most commonly referenced mechanical properties  along with any corresponding astm and deutsches institut f  r normung   german institute for standardisation  din  test references  the range of values typical of commercially available pc pump elastomers is included to show the variations that exist in these properties    file vol  page     image      png    table        chemical resistance is normally evaluated through compatibility testing with the fluids in question  elastomer samples are exposed to the fluid in an autoclave environment for a predetermined period of time  typically    or     hours   then  the volume and mass change are measured  to be representative  these tests should also assess the change in mechanical properties through measurements of hardness and  if possible  tensile strength and elongation  because these tests are performed on small samples  which seldom come from actual pumps  for a limited period of time  they are most useful for ranking elastomers as opposed to determining the actual swell level within a stator   the chemical and mechanical properties of an elastomer are very sensitive to temperature  and the nature of changes in these properties can vary dramatically between elastomers  although testing is normally done at room temperature  in most cases the mechanical properties will deteriorate significantly with increasing temperature  the rate of fluid swell will also increase at higher temperatures  although in most cases the ultimate level of swell will remain the same  whenever possible  any testing to evaluate elastomers should be done as close to the anticipated downhole conditions as practical      pc pump elastomers     most pc pump manufacturers have stator products available with several different elastomer types  because the formulations of these elastomers are considered proprietary  there is no st

urea   ammonia is the second largest chemical product produced in the world  behind sulfuric acid  the demand for ammonia is driven by the demand for fertilizers  of the world   s nitrogen demand      is for fertilizer primarily derived from ammonia in the form of     urea   ammonium nitrate   phosphate   sulfate  other uses of ammonia include fibers  resins  refrigeration  and pulp and paper industries   ammonia can be produced from different hydrocarbon feedstocks such as natural gas  coal  and oil  natural gas accounts for more than     of ammonia tonnage  natural gas is the preferred feedstock primarily because     it is intrinsically the most hydrogen rich and  therefore  contributes more hydrogen compared with other feedstocks on a unit weight basis      the heavier feedstocks  like coal and oil  are more complex to process  therefore  the capital costs are higher compared to natural gas    a relatively small volume       of ammonia that is produced is traded as ammonia  this is a result of the difficulty of using ammonia directly as a fertilizer  most farmers prefer a solid fertilizer  these factors drive the producers of ammonia to either develop regional markets for ammonia or convert the ammonia to urea  a dry solid that can be stored and moved relatively easily and cheaply  for stranded gas  away from the regional markets  the integration of the ammonia and urea plants makes commercial sense  it should be noted that the production of urea requires co   in addition to ammonia   which is a byproduct of ammonia production    in year       ammonia was a

end uses for urea are     fertilizers   formaldehyde urea resins   plastics   fibers    history   the first commercial ammonia plant was commissioned in the early   th century on the basis of the fundamental research work of haber  bosch and his engineering team developed the ammonia synthesis process with a promoted iron based catalyst  since then  there has been no fundamental change in the ammonia synthesis reaction itself  a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen reacts on the iron catalyst at elevated temperatures in the range of     to      c operating at pressure above     bar          h    n   amp rlarr    nh            the unconverted part of the synthesis gas is recirculated  after the removal of ammonia  and supplemented with fresh synthesis gas to compensate for the amount of nitrogen and hydrogen converted to ammonia  the production of ammonia synthesis gas  consisting of pure hydrogen and nitrogen  is the largest single contributor of the production cost of ammonia  hence  in contrast to the ammonia synthesis section  dramatic changes have been made over the years in the technology for the generation of synthesis gas  net energy consumption has been reduced

gas under pressure  sulfur compounds  if any  in the feed gas have to be removed before the reforming process  the basic reactions involved in the steam reforming of methane  which is the main constituent of natural gas  are represented by the following reactions        ch  h o amp rlarr  co  h and co h o amp rlarr  co  h             the required stoichiometric hydrogen to nitrogen ratio is achieved by introducing air into the process  it is typically done by splitting the reforming into two steps      primary reforming   secondary reforming  in primary reforming  the natural gas is reformed with steam in furnace tubes packed with nickel catalyst  natural gas burners in the furnace radiation box supply the intense heat needed for the endothermic reaction  the reaction is controlled to achieve only a partial conversion  leaving approximately     methane in the effluent gas  dry basis  at temperatures of approximately     to      c   the effluent gas is then introduced into a secondary reformer  a refractory lined vessel filled with nickel catalyst  in which it is mixed with a controlled amount of air introduced through a burner  this raises the temperature of the

with a single set of tools for importing  exporting  viewing  editing  and performing database administration  by centralizing all data available for an e amp p asset in a single integrated data store  project data management systems greatly reduce the amount of time spent moving data between applications  data management systems serve as readily accessible repositories for the knowledge about an

its own private  proprietary data store  each individual data store supported different data exchange formats and procedures  moving data between applications involved exporting files  reformatting them manually  and importing them into the target application  this process was often so cumbersome that data were not exchanged at all  or they could be exchanged only by manually retyping the data into each application  project data management systems allow applications to share data without moving them from application to application  outputs created by one application are automatically

relatively cheap and powerful horizontal market database tools   the most mature database management systems are    relational databases     relational databases have been used by many industries to store mission critical data for more than    years  researchers at ibm performed much of the early research on the relational model in the late     s and early     s codd  e f        a relational model of data for large shared data banks  commun  acm                 a relational model views data logically as a series of tables and columns  with a mathematical model for operations on these structures  the physical arrangement of data is hidden  instead  one depends only on a simple  logical view of tabular data  all data are reduced to the simple    flat    tabular form  relational databases support sql  which allows users to build queries that filter the rows of a single table  sql queries can also combine data from one table with data from another on the basis of shared foreign key fields  this allows sql statements to join data from multiple tables and build powerful ad hoc reports        relational database       relational database management systems range from desktop databases to enterprise data management systems  robust database systems typically provide    network access to data  flexible and powerful data security  tools for    hot backups     allowing a system to be backed up without shutting down  recovery tools in case of a system crash   a rich set of utilities that allow administrators to configure  control  and monitor the system   several very powerful tools have been developed for working with relational databases  these include systems that generate flexible ad hoc reports with rich format control and systems to build queries graphically without the use of sql  many tools that were originally designed for the horizontal market can be used when working with e amp p data  these tools expose the data model of the underlying database  for a project database to be readily accessible by these generic tools  it must use relational technology and have a relatively simple and well documented data model        object oriented database       object oriented databases are a newer trend in database management systems  they have the flexibility to store complex  structured data  and to associate software logic with that data

heavy oil to light gas       in many cases  the hydrocarbons are greater than critical pressure and temperature conditions  greater than critical point   properties then can vary continuously from liquid like  for oils with gas in solution  to gas like  for mixtures of light molecular weight  with changing pressure and temperature conditions  phase boundaries can be crossed  resulting in abrupt changes in fluid properties  additional components are often injected during production  further complicating the distribution of compositions and properties   see also phase diagrams       gas     the gas phase is the easiest to characterize  the compounds are usually relatively simple  and the thermodynamic properties have been thoroughly examined  hydrocarbon gases usually consist of the light hydrocarbons of methane  butane  and propane  additional gases  such as water vapor and heavier hydrocarbons  will occur in the gas depending on the pressure  temperature  and history of the deposit  the specific weight of these gases  as compared to air at standard temperature and pressure  will vary from about     for nearly pure methane to over     for gases with heavier components  fortunately  when a rough idea of the gas weight is known  a fairly accurate estimate can be made of the gas properties at pressure and temperatures  thomas   et al   thomas  l k   hankinson  r w

discussion below follows a similar analysis       ideal gas law      the important seismic characteristics of a fluid  the bulk modulus  density  and sonic velocity  are all related to primary thermodynamic properties  therefore  for gases  we are obliged to start with the ideal gas law   rtenotitle                         where      p   is pressure    v   is volume  n is the number of moles of the gas    r   is the gas constant    t    a   the absolute temperature  this leads to a density         of  rtenotitle                         where   m   is the molecular weight  the isothermal compressibility         t   is  rtenotitle                         for compressibility defined as a positive number   if we calculate the  quot isothermal quot  velocity   v    t    we find  rtenotitle                         for an ideal gas  the acoustic velocity is controlled by the stiffness of the material and its density  see the derivation compressional and shear velocities   therefore  velocity would increase with temperature and be independent of pressure       modification for real gasses      two mitigating factors bring the relationship closer to reality  first  because there are rapid temperature changes associated with the passage of an acoustic wave  we must use the adiabatic compressibility          s    rather than the isothermal compressibility                s             t     here         is the ratio of heat capacity at constant pressure to the heat capacity at constant volume  in most solid materials  the difference between the isothermal and adiabatic compressibilities is negligible  however  in fluid phases  particularly gases  the isothermal compressibility can be twice the adiabatic value   the second  more obvious factor stems from the inadequacies of the ideal gas law     eq        the gas law can be corrected by adding a compressibility factor    z     the relationships are thus modified   rtenotitle

characterization because the physical and chemical properties of the rock that holds hydrocarbons and or water affect the response of every tool used to measure formation properties  understanding reservoir lithology is the foundation from which all other petrophysical calculations are made  to make accurate petrophysical calculations of porosity  water saturation    s    w     and permeability  the various lithologies of the reservoir interval must be identified and their implications understood  lithology means  quot the composition or type of rock such as sandstone or limestone  quot  hynes  n j        dictionary of petroleum exploration  drilling  and production  tulsa  oklahoma  pennwell  these few words belie a host of details about reservoir rocks    their depositional and diagenetic history  pore structure  mineralogy     definitions     the term lithology is used as a gross identification for a rock layer in the subsurface and uses familiar names such as    sandstone  or sand   limestone  dolostone  or dolomite   claystone  or clay   chert  coal  shale  or mudrock   diatomite  halite  anhydrite  gypsum  tuff   the preceding list is not exhaustive  for detailed lists  see deesondeeson  a f l        the collector   s encyclopedia of rocks  amp  minerals  new york city  clarkson n  potter inc    the term rock type is a more detailed description than lithology because it reflects the natural groupings of pore systems that produce recognizable properties used to predict    flow properties  volumes  fluid saturations  lithology focuses on grains  while rock type focuses on pores  the list of rock types contains more than     classifications   personal communication with r m  sneider  r m  sneider exploration inc   houston           another term used in the literature is the greek equivalent  quot petrofacies  quot   another term that is finally dropping from use is the incorrectly named  quot electrofacies  quot       direct determination     obtaining a physical sample of the reservoir is the surest way to unambiguously determine lithology and rock type  but obtaining this physical sample is not always easy  mud logs are the first choice in wildcat wells  but exact assignment of a rock fragment to a particular depth is not without error  the size of the individual rock sample examined at the surface is rather small because it is limited by the size of drill cuttings and rock strength  weak rocks  ones without cement  are often reduced to original detrital grain size by the drilling process  making it difficult to determine rock type  but still possible to determine lithology  once the well is drilled and logged and rock layers are marked for further study  rock samples can be obtained through the use of wireline core takers or sidewall core drills   recovery of sidewall samples is not always a sure thing  and we often fail to get rock samples from zones of interest  in a wildcat well with a zone of high interest identified with logs  rock samples  and fluid samples  we can plug back the well several hundred feet  set a whipstock  perform a parallel sidetrack  called a bypass hole   and then take a whole core across the zone of interest  because the two holes are parallel  we know exactly at which depth to swap out the drill bit with a core barrel  the resulting whole core can be sampled  and sophisticated core analysis can be used to identify the rock type of each zone and determine petrophysical parameters  which are used to refine the formation evaluation from the log data      indirect determination     if no direct rock sample is available in a given zone  log responses must be used alone to simultaneously determine lithology  porosity  and fluid saturations  rock typing is much more involved and requires the use of commercially available catalogs of analog dataa catalog of petrophysical and geological properties of typical reservoir rocks        houston  shell oil co the world wide rock catalog        houston  reservoirs inc  or locally collected data to pinpoint petrophysical properties that can be used to refine porosity and fluid saturation calculations  if  in a given wellbore  one is lucky enough to encounter parts of the desired reservoir below the free water level  then fluid saturation is known and gross lithology can be determined from routine wireline logs such as density  neutron  and acoustic tools  all wireline service companies provide charts and answer products that convert wireline logging data into lithology  however  few beds are simple homogeneous layers  see article on reservoir geology   if some of the layers are beneath the resolving thickness of the tool  some average response of the layers  depending on bed and borehole geometry  can be observed  single layers of salt  nacl   anhydrite  gypsum  coal  or tuft are easily identified when several feet thick or thicker

characteristics and manufacturing processes for the two bit types are  in respect to body construction  different  because of the nature of the materials from which they are made  the lower impact toughness of matrix limits some matrix bit features  such as blade height  conversely  steel is ductile  tough  and capable of withstanding greater impact loads  this makes it possible for steel body

material capabilities  complex bit profiles and hydraulic designs are possible and relatively easy to construct on a multi axis  computer numerically controlled milling machine  a beneficial feature of steel bits is that they can easily be rebuilt a number of times because worn or damaged cutters can be replaced rather easily  this is a particular advantage for operators in low cost drilling environments        development of pdc bits       fortunately  both steels and matrix are rapidly evolving  and their limitations are diminishing  as hard facing materials improve  steel bits are

prevailing magnetic field is  quot frozen quot  in the rocks as they solidify  giving them a strong natural remnant magnetization   a primary application has been to identify points in time at which the earth   s magnetic field has undergone a polarity reversal  these reversals have been dated globally  e g   isotopically in the case of volcanic series or by correlation with biostratigraphy in the case of volcaniclastics  and have given rise to a geomagnetic polarity time scale  gpts  that is based on laboratory measurements  this  in turn  has allowed dates to be assigned to a given magnetozone that is bounded by reversal phenomena  it has been possible to recognize these reversals through downhole measurements and  therefore  to date the rocks accordingly   sedimentary rocks have much weaker remnant magnetizations than igneous sequences  and it has been much more difficult to investigate their magnetic character  however  recent advances in instrumentation have led to

three parts  the earth   s magnetic field of the present day  the field that is induced in the rocks by the prevailing earth   s field  and the remnant magnetic field  which is the preservation in the rocks of a paleomagnetic field  the effect of the earth   s magnetic field can be accommodated during logging by extrapolating downhole the measurements made by a surface magnetometer that records diurnal variations in the earth   s field and allows the downhole data to be corrected for these variations where they are significant  the induced field is proportional to the magnetic susceptibility

induction associated with the present earth   s field    b    i   is the magnetic induction caused by the field induced in the rock  and   b    r   is the magnetic induction caused by the remnant

 r   are no more than a few tens of nanotesla  and they have to be measured against a prevailing earth   s field that is a thousand times greater  therefore  the exercise becomes very much one of

coalescence occurs within the cyclone  a problem with some cyclones is that a poorly designed liquid outlet can shear the liquids  offsetting the benefits of the coalescence and possibly making the situation worse  for cases in which a high liquid level is required in the separator  the inlet cyclone can be submerged up to the gas outlet level  moreover  the cylone inlet allows the use of a shorter retention time due to the rapid degass process  in which large bubble foam is minimized or eliminated  without the cyclonic inlet  foam can occupy a considerable volume in the separator  the use of a cyclonic inlet often allows foam to be ignored as a sizing consideration  thus  for high capacity crude oil separators  which are the ones most limited by foam   the cyclone inlet can

section at the top  for injection well logging  two gamma ray detectors below the reservoir and pump are preferable  some tools employ only one detector  but this is less desirable  the tool includes the circuitry to amplify and transmit the detector counts to the surface  for recording   most natural radioactivity underground is from the decay of isotopes of potassium  thorium  and uranium  these materials concentrate in the shales  where they register approximately     api units on the gamma ray log  once downhole  a  quot slug quot  of tracer is ejected by the pump  under surface control  the activity owing to the ejected slug is much greater than the natural background activity  by tracking the progress of the slug down the wellbore  the exits of injected flow from the wellbore can be determined  as well as whether any of the injection  after exiting  passes through a channel close to the pipe      modes of logging     there are two modes of logging with radioactive tracers    slug tracking  velocity shot      slug tracking      for slug tracking  the logging operator ejects a slug of tracer from the tool  after ejection  the tool is run up and down through the slug to ensure that the slug is uniformly mixed across the wellbore cross section  then  the tool is lowered quickly and an upward logging pass is made at constant logging speed until the slug is detected  the time of detection of the peak and the depth of the peak are recorded  then the tool is quickly lowered again  and another upward logging pass is made at the constant logging speed until the slug is detected again  again  the time of detection of the peak and the depth of the peak are recorded  this process is repeated several times  resulting in a succession of detections of the same slug  see    fig         as long as the peak progresses downward  there is flow in or near the wellbore  once the peak stops  there is no flow in or near the wellbore below the stopping depth  for each detection  the area under the trace and above the common baseline of the traces is proportional to the percentage of injection still in or near the wellbore    file vol  page      image      png    fig        a

the injection leaves the wellbore between d and the bottom of the perforation set  a convenient measure proportional to slug area is the product of the slug   s height  above a common baseline  and the slug   s width at half height  numbers from the areas agree with those shown on the left side of    fig       as derived from the travel times  slug a is not yet mixed in the flow  slug area has the advantage of being insensitive to variations in fluid velocity  allowing the approach to be extended to traced slugs moving behind casing  notice in    fig       that activity also is detected below the perforations  a slug was ejected below the perforations  upward logging passes showed that the peak of this slug was stationary  therefore  there is no wellbore flow below the perforations  and the activity below the perforations is attributable to tracer channeling downward behind the pipe   generally  only one gamma ray detector is used for slug tracking  slug tracking gives the best overview of where injection leaves the wellbore and whether  after exiting  any injection travels in a channel close to the pipe  the upward logging passes are made at high line speed  a constant logging speed should be used  and the same speed should be used for all passes   provided the ejected slug is uniformly mixed in the flow by movement of the tool up and down through the slug after ejection  the vertical distance  ft  between two successive peaks in total flow divided by the time  minutes  between detection of the peaks provides an accurate estimate of the average flow velocity of total injection  such velocities are listed on the left of    fig        the most frequently used tagging material for water is an aqueous solution of sodium iodide  which contains the isotope of iodine  i      the   day half life is ideal  in solution  the iodine does not stick to rock surfaces  instead  with continued injection  the iodine is washed from the rock surfaces and carried away from the near wellbore  beyond detection by the logging tool   from inspection of slug spacing in    fig        it is evident that slug tracking has limited vertical resolution  furthermore  because     of the detected gamma rays originate within   ft of the detector  the tracer tool   s depth of investigation is also limited and is much less than that of the temperature tool  because of the limited depth of investigation  tracer that is channeling after exiting the wellbore must be close to the pipe

alternative  especially in high gas liquid ratio  glr  gas and oil wells     fig            plunger lift uses a free piston that travels up and down in the well   s tubing string  it minimizes liquid fallback and uses the well   s energy more efficiently than does slug or bubble flow  as with other artificial lift methods  the purpose of plunger lift is to remove liquids from the wellbore so that the well can be produced at the lowest bottomhole pressures    cd edition includes video clips      basic plunger animation   and   plunger lift system          file vol  page     image      png    fig         plunger installed in canada   courtesy of ferguson beauregard        whether in a gas well  oil well  or gas lift well  the mechanics of a plunger lift system are the same  the plunger  a length of steel  is dropped through the tubing to the bottom of the well and allowed to travel back to the surface  it provides a piston like interface between liquids and gas in the wellbore and prevents liquid fallback   a part of the liquid load that effectively is lost because it is left behind  because the plunger provides a  quot seal quot  between the liquid and the gas  a well   s own energy can be used to lift liquids out of the wellbore efficiently     a plunger changes the rules for liquid removal  in a well without a plunger  gas velocity must be high to remove liquids  but with a plunger  gas velocity can be very low  thus  the plunger system is economical because it needs minimal equipment and uses the well   s gas pressure as the energy source  used with low line pressures or compression  plunger lift can produce many types of wells to depletion     in recent years  the advent of microprocessors and electronic controllers  the studies detailing the importance of plunger seal and velocity  and an increased focus on gas production have led to a much wider use and broader application of plunger lift  microprocessors and electronic controllers have increased the reliability of plunger lift  earlier controllers were on off timers or pressure switches that needed frequent adjustment to deal with operating condition changes such as line pressures  plunger wear  variable production rates  and system upsets  this frustrated many operators and caused failures  and thus limited plunger use  new controllers contain computers that can sense plunger problems and make immediate adjustments  techniques with telemetry  electronic data collection  and troubleshooting software continue to improve plunger lift performance and ease of use     traditionally  plunger lift was used on oil wells   as the wells started to load or as a means of gas lift assist   and many early articles discussed optimization of liquid production  plunger lift lately has become more common on gas wells  and papers from the     s onward have focused on this aspect    in the     s  several studies were conducted in the field and on test wells to verify     s and     s models and to better understand plunger operation  morrow and rogers  mower   et al     lea  and rosina  among others  presented papers that verified and modified earlier models presented by beeson   et al    and foss and gaul  importantly  for example  these studies clarified the relationship between plunger seal and velocity  indicating that a plunger that more completely seals against the tubing and travels at the proper ascent velocity minimizes gas slippage around the plunger  reducing gas slippage allows the well to operate more efficiently at lower bottomhole pressures  which in turn increases production  the studies also found that efficient ascent velocities for various plungers range from     to       ft min  these velocity data have been used successfully to improve methods for controlling and optimizing plunger lift cycles and to produce highly efficient plungers     these improvements have enabled plunger lift to be used for a broader range of well types and conditions  allowing its application even in extremely low pressure wells         b d   deep wells           ft   slimhole wells         to       in  casing   and wells with packers  operators have successfully used plunger lift in paraffin   scale   sand   and hydrate production environments     success in plunger lift systems depends on proper candidate identification  proper well installation  and the effectiveness of the operator  candidate identification primarily consists of choosing a well with the proper glr and adequate well buildup pressure  however  makeup gas or compression can be used to amend unmet glr and buildup pressure requirements     proper well installation is important  a plunger must travel freely from the bottom of the well to the top and back to the bottom  carry well

component solubility is less than     mol  at ambient conditions  this splitting of phases affects almost all treatments of mixed water and hydrocarbon systems and is caused by the different molecular attractions within water and hydrocarbons  hydrocarbon molecules have a weak  noncharged attraction for each other  while water attracts other water molecules through a strong  charged hydrogen bond

surface and subsurface equipment and facilities  while many samples are collected downhole or at the surface while the fluids are still pressurized  useful information may also be gained from samples collected at atmospheric pressure  nonpressurized   this article discusses considerations for collecting such samples  it also includes information from an american petroleum institute  api  standard on sampling from oil tanks that is no longer available      overview     the sampling of nonpressurized or atmospheric pressure hydrocarbon fluids from lines is relatively simple to perform  but attention must be paid to the need to purge sampling lines and pipework with at least three times their volume of fresh fluid before each sampling session  this is especially important in some installations and processing facilities  where the sampling point may be at the end of a  quot dead leg quot  or trap in which fluid has collected or stagnated over a long period of time  in general  oil or condensate samples should be collected from a sample tap on the side of the line or the top of the line to avoid any water or sediment that may have accumulated at the bottom of the line  atmospheric gas samples are rarely collected  but if they are required  they should be collected in evacuated chambers to minimize contamination by air      collecting samples for analysis     atmospheric hydrocarbon samples also may be collected from pressurized lines or from samples collected in pressurized chambers  such as downhole samples  usually  this will involve the release of gas and the collection of oil or condensate  because the separation procedure that releases gas is dependent on the temperature and pressure  which may be above atmospheric if the liquid is collected in a closed trap   the properties of samples collected in this way may vary  also  because the fluid in a sample chamber may already be in two phase condition  or may have segregated   liquid from the entire sample should be collected to minimize uncertainty in the sample quality      sampling from oil tanks     sampling from tanks is complicated by the need to collect samples from various depths to allow for any property changes or segregation that may exist  the procedure given next is a traditional method used for measuring and testing a field tank of crude oil  frequently referred to as

required in water depths of  gt        ft  there have been a number of unpublished examples  however  in which application of the technology was needed in water depths as shallow as       ft  the need for dgds is caused by the reduced fracture gradient of formations below the mudline  resulting from the reduced weight  or gradient      vs      psi ft   which  itself  is a result of water above the

gained by these systems can be noted by comparing    figs    and       for the conventional drilling case  fig      the gradient in the wellbore is relative to the drillship in all cases  because the mud column is hydraulically continuous from the bottom of the hole up the riser to the drillship  this results in additional pressure being applied at the mudline  mud density minus seawater density times water depth times a units constant   the increased    backpressure    at the mudline has the effect of minimizing the drilling distance between casing points  the pressure at the bottom of the hole over a particular interval is usually referred to as equivalent circulating density  the equivalent circulating density from the mudline to total depth for conventional riser systems is always greater than for subsea systems in which the pressure  both circulating and static  required to get the mud from the mudline to the drillship is hydraulically isolated from the borehole or greatly

reaction period  the remaining ester and the product alcohol tracers are located together    to    ft from the wellbore  the tracers then are ready to be back produced to the wellbore and monitored at the surface in the produced water      fig       shows the chromatographic separation of the product alcohol and ester tracers  this separation occurs because the product alcohol and water velocities are essentially the same  whereas the ester production velocity is slower because the ester must partition between the oil and water

focus will be primarily on nonassociated accumulations  but much of the fluid behavior  flow regimes  and recovery aspects are also applicable to gas caps associated with oil columns in this chapter  gas reservoirs have been divided into three groups  dry gas  wet gas  and retrograde condensate gas  a dry gas reservoir is defined as producing a single composition of gas that is constant in the reservoir  wellbore  and lease separation equipment throughout the life of a field  some liquids may be recovered by processing in a gas plant  a wet gas reservoir is defined as producing a single gas composition to the producing well perforations throughout its life  condensate will form either while flowing to the surface or in lease separation equipment  a retrograde condensate gas reservoir initially contains a single phase fluid  which changes to two phases  condensate and gas  in the reservoir when the reservoir pressure decreases  additional condensate forms with changes in pressure and temperature in the tubing and during lease separation  from a reservoir standpoint  dry and wet gas can be treated similarly in terms of producing characteristics  pressure behavior  and recovery potential  wellbore hydraulics may be different  studies of retrograde condensate gas reservoirs must consider changes in condensate yield as reservoir pressure declines  the potential for decreased well deliverability as liquid saturations increase near the wellbore  and the effects of two phase flow on wellbore hydraulics a comprehensive discussion of gas and condensate properties and phase behavior can be found in several chapters of the general engineering section of this   handbook    aspects of predicting wellbore hydraulics are covered in the production operations engineering

geomechanical design  if few  or no  wells have been drilled in an area  or few measurements exist from earlier wells  developing a reliable geomechanical model will be more challenging      geomechanical design with very little data     it is not necessary to have a well constrained stress state to utilize geomechanical design principals  sometimes  knowing just the stress regime  normal  strike slip  or reverse   it is possible to estimate relative risk as a function of wellbore deviation and determine the importance of knowing the stress orientation  if geological analysis provides information about stress orientation as well  it is also possible to determine the relative risk as a function of wellbore azimuth      fig       shows relative wellbore stability as a function of wellbore orientation at       ft in normal  strike slip  and reverse faulting regimes  in all cases    s    h  max is oriented east west  e w    as can be seen  the required mud weights and their variation with azimuth and deviation are quite different  the lowest mud weights are required in a normal faulting environment  mud weight increases with deviation when both horizontal stresses are low  and there is only a small sensitivity of mud weight to drilling direction  required mud weights are higher in the strike slip regime  and there is a larger variation with drilling direction  especially at higher deviations  vertical wells require the highest mud weight in this case  to drill in a reverse faulting environment  very high mud weights are necessary regardless of well orientation  the highest mud weights are required for vertical wells and for wells deviated to the north or south  the direction of the minimum horizontal stress   regardless of the amount of deviation   mud weight decreases with increasing deviation in other directions  and the lowest mud weights are required for wells drilled with high deviations to the east and west  based on plots similar to    fig        it is possible  given only an indication of the stress regime and its orientation  for example  based on the orientations of currently active faults   to define the relative mud weight required for wells drilled at different orientations  if seismic data are available  and the velocity data can be inverted to constrain pore pressure and rock strength  it is possible to

if the temperature of the in situ combustion process stays at or below the negative temperature gradient region  the oil displacement efficiency will be very low  this is because lto increases the oil viscosity and fuel content  the injected air flux in a heavy oil project should be maintained at a value well above the value needed to maintain the reactions in the high temperature oxidation regime

tools and methods employed to drill those wells       applications        multiple wells from a single location  field developments  particularly offshore and in the arctic  involve drilling an optimum number of wells from a single platform or artificial island  directional drilling has helped by greatly reducing the costs and environmental impact of this application     inaccessible surface locations  a well is directionally drilled to reach a producing zone that is otherwise inaccessible with normal vertical drilling practices  the location of a producing formation dictates the remote rig location and directional well profile  applications like this are where  quot extended reach quot  wells are most commonly drilled     multiple target zones  a very cost effective way of delivering high production rates involves intersecting multiple targets with a single wellbore  there are certain cases in which the attitudes  bed dips  of the producing formations are such that the most economical approach is a directional well for a multiple completion  this is also applicable to multiple production zones adjacent to a fault plane or beneath a salt dome     sidetrack  this technique may be employed either to drill around obstructions or to reposition the bottom of the wellbore for geological reasons  drilling around obstructions  such as a lost string of pipe  is usually accomplished with a blind sidetrack  oriented sidetrack is required if a certain direction is critical in locating an anticipated producing formation     fault drilling  it is often difficult to drill a vertical well through a steeply inclined fault plane to reach an underlying hydrocarbon bearing formation  instead  the wellbore may be deflected perpendicular or parallel to the fault for better production  in unstable areas  a wellbore drilled through a fault zone could be at risk because of the possibility of slippage or movement along the fault  formation pressures along fault planes may also affect hole conditions     salt dome exploration  producing formations can be found under the hard  overhanging cap of salt domes  drilling a vertical well through a salt dome increases the possibility of drilling problems  such as washouts  lost circulation  and corrosion     relief well drilling  an uncontrolled  wild  well is intersected near its source  mud and water are then pumped into the relief well to kill the wild one  directional control is extremely exacting for this type of application     river crossing applications  directional drilling is employed extensively for placing pipelines that cross beneath rivers  and has even been used by telecommunication companies to install fiber optic cables  __toc__    directional well profiles     a directional well can be divided into three main sections   the surface hole  overburden section  and reservoir penetration  different factors are involved at each stage within the overall constraints of optimum reservoir penetration      surface hole section     most directional wells are drilled from multiwell installations  platforms  or drillsites  minimizing the cost or environmental footprint requires that wells be spaced as closely as possible  it has been found that spacing on the order of   m    ft  can be achieved  at the start of the well  the overriding constraint on the well path is the presence of other wells  careful planning is required to assign well slots to bottomhole locations in a manner that avoids the need for complex directional steering within the cluster of wells  at its worst  the opportunity to reach certain targets from the installation can be lost if not carefully planned from the outset  visualizing the relative positions of adjacent wells is important for correct decisions to be made about placing the well path to minimize the number of adjacent wells that must be shut in as a safety precaution against collisions  the steel in nearby wells requires that special downhole survey techniques be used to ensure accurate positioning  this section is generally planned with very low curvatures to minimize problems in excessive torque and casing wear resulting from high contact forces between drillstrings and the hole wall    many directional wells are drilled from surface pads and offshore locations  close surface locations always have the potential for collisions near the surface  planning proper surface hole surveying strategies to prevent collisions is critical in well planning  gyro surveys  single multiple shots  are often used to eliminate problems associated with close wellbore spacing  modern well planning software has used the survey uncertainty model in the anticollision calculat

projects with highly uncertain outcomes  we drill complex wells and build gas plants  refineries  platforms  and pipelines where costly problems can occur and where associated revenues might be disappointing  we may lose our investment  we may make a handsome profit  we are in a risky business  assessing the outcomes  assigning probabilities of occurrence and associated values  is how we analyze and prepare to manage risk an interest in quantifying risk and formalizing complex decisions requires a review of the methods available  while what is presented here is not exhaustive  it serves as a starting point for the engineer or geoscientist interested in risk analysis risk and decision analysis software is as diverse as the analysis methods themselves  there are programs to do monte carlo simulation and decision tree analysis  analytic models to do economics can be linked to both monte carlo simulation and decision trees  closely related are optimization  sensitivity analysis  and influence diagrams  extending further  we encounter forecasting  expert systems  and fuzzy logic  within geoscientists  purview are mapping packages and geostatistics software  both of which have the potential to offer strong support to the analysis of uncertainty our focus is with the two primary uncertainty methods  monte carlo simulation and decision trees  along with the review of fundamentals of probability and statistics language necessary to carry out analysis and present results  __toc__     overview           historical perspective      uncertainty analysis evolved during the latter half of the   th century  its underpinnings in statistics and probability were in place by       problem solving  especially in industrial engineering and operations research  was introduced in midcentury  following more theoretical modeling in physics  chemistry  and mathematics in the early     s  the computer revolution  and in particular the availability of desktop computers and spreadsheet programs in the     s and     s  supplied the final ingredient of course  there had to be motivation and hard problems to solve  oil gas companies became more technical  and competition for funds demanded analysis of profitability  numerical simulation methods such as reservoir and geostatistical models became established tools  making it easier to argue for monte carlo and decision tree tools     sec          presents a more complete discussion of the historical perspective of risk analysis       language of risk analysis and decision making      any description of monte carlo simulation and decision trees must devote some time to the underpinnings of statistics and probability  undergraduate engineering programs sometimes include one course in statistics  and graduate programs often require one  unfortunately  what engineers take away from those classes does not always prepare them to deal with uncertainty analysis  for whatever reason  engineers do not gain a level of comfort with the language nor see immediate use for it in their jobs    sec          introduces the concepts of central tendency  mean  mode  and median   dispersion  standard deviation  ranges  and confidence intervals   and skewness  as well as the graphical tools  histograms  density functions  and cumulative distributions  necessary to communicate ideas of uncertainty about a single variable  correlation and regression  especially the former  serve to describe the relationship between two parameters  we use excel to illustrate these descriptive statistics this section clarifies what it means to fit historical data  the premise is that we usually have a small sample taken from a huge population  which we wish to describe  the process begins by constructing a histogram from the data and then seeking a density function that resembles the histogram  this statistical tool contrasts sharply with the well known linear regression  in spite of the fact that their metrics to judge the goodness of fit appear similar three common distribution types   normal  log normal  and binomial   are discussed at length to assist users in choosing an appropriate type when building a model  the central limit theorem establishes guidelines about sums and products of distributions  a cousin of statistics  probability theory  paves the way to introduce bayes  theorem  which is invoked in prospect evaluation to ensure consistent logic for revising probabilities       the tools of the trade         sec          is the heart of this chapter  monte carlo simulation and decision trees are defined and illustrated  compared and contrasted  some problems yield to one or the other of these tools  occasionally  both methods can serve a useful purpose  decision trees are visual  their impact diminishes as the model becomes larger and more complex  decision trees rely on expected value  but decision makers do not

approach  premodeling organization involves determining project goals and then designing a workflow     fig        to monitor the progress of the reservoir study  the workflow provides a system of checks and balances that ensures that the necessary data are ready at the appropriate times in the project  it also guarantees that an integrated approach is followed  because each step requires the

principles involved in clinical imaging also apply to imaging any fluid saturated porous media  including reservoir rocks  the petroleum industry quickly adapted this technology to petrophysical

useful in well cementing applications  they are the single derivatized hydroxyethyl cellulos  hec  and twice derivatized carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose cmhec  the usefulness of the two materials depends on their retardational character and thermal stability limits       hydroxyethyl cellulose      this is commonly used at temperatures up to approximately     c       f  for fluid loss control  and may be used at temperatures up to approximately      c       f  bhct  depending on the co additives used and slurry viscosity limitations  above      c       f   hec is not thermally stable  hec is typically used at a concentration of     to      by weight of cement  bwoc   densities ranging from      to      lbm gal  and temperatures ranging from    to     c     to      f  bhct to achieve a fluid loss of less than     cm      min       carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose      this is commonly used at temperatures up to      f for fluid loss control and may be used at temperatures up to approximately      f  depending on degree of substitution  the co additives used  and slurry viscosity limitations  cmhec is more thermally stable than hec  and is not as susceptible to oxidative attack      synthetic polymers     since the     s  a significant amount of work has been performed concerning synthetic copolymers for use in cement slurries  most of this work has centered on copolymers of acrylamide and or acrylamide derivatives and their salts  however  several nonacrylamide based monomers have also been reviewed       polyvinyl pyrrolidone  pvp       this is a nonionic polymer that is typically used as a fluid loss enhancer in conjunction with sodium naphthalene sulfonate condensed with formaldehyde  snfc  to improve the performance of other polymers  when used alone  pvp is not very effective as an fluid loss control agents  fla   however  when pvp is used in conjunction with snfc  the fluid loss is improved through improved particle orientation  pvp snfc is particularly advantageous when used in densified cements for both dispersion and fluid loss control  the use of pvp snfc  in conjunction with hec or cmhec  results in significant improvement in fluid loss control  surfactants are surface active agents that may be used to modify the interfacial tension between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid  low molecular weight polymers such as snfc and lignosulfonate are surfactants  the choice of the proper surfactant can have a significant effect on the fla itself  and its interaction with cement particles  surfactants can be used to accelerate or retard the solubility or wettability of polymers      lost circulation additives     cement slurries can be lost to the formation and not circulated back to the surface during completion of a wellbore  this is defined as lost circulation  it should not be confused with the volume decrease resulting from fluid loss filtration  lost circulation tends to occur in three basic formation types    unconsolidated or highly permeable  it is considered that the particles of a cement slurry can enter an unconsolidated or highly permeable formation only if the permeability is greater than     darcies   fractured  induced or natural  induced fractures occur in highly incompetent zones  e g   shale  that break down at relatively low hydrostatic pressures  natural fractures can be encountered anywhere   cavernous or vuggy  these are usually formed by erosion of the formation caused by the action of subsurface waters and are discovered unexpectedly   in many cases  lost circulation occurs during drilling with loss of drilling fluids  and actions can be taken at that time to combat the lost circulation  at other times  difficulties may be encountered during drilling  indicating potential lost circulation problems  and measures can be taken to prevent their occurrence during cementing  typically  there are two steps in combating lost circulation  reducing slurry density and adding a bridging or plugging material       additives categories for lost circulation      additives for prevention of lost circulation can be separated into three basic groups    bridging materials  rapid setting or thixotropic cements  lightweight cementing systems       bridging materials       bridging materials physically bridge over and or plug the lost circulation zone  and are typically available in fibrous  flake  or granular form  most bridging materials are considered to be chemically inert with respect to cement hydration   fibrous materials are  in general  used for controlling lost circulation in highly permeable formations where the fibers form a mat over the surface   the most common flake material is cellophane  cellophane flakes act by forming mats or bridges over very narrow fractures  concentration range of cellophane is usually from       to     lbm sk   granular materials are

any hydraulic pump  the equations are sufficiently complex that a computer should be used although a hand held calculator can be used if the glr is    or less  a flowing gradient correlation is not required   that being said  the pumps used in a given area tend to be very similar and additional pumps will often be the same as those already in use  in such a case  then an analysis is typically done just for the initial installations  however  subsequent analyses are frequently done for the purpose of optimizing the performance of the pumps in the different wells     computer needs   computer programs are available from the manufacturers for both piston and jet pumps  and are typically provided at no cost to the user  these programs are only provided in a complied format as the manufacturers consider the programing code to be confidential   a computer is always required whenever the glr is greater than     a flowing gradient correlation is required  as the solution is an iterative process when gas is present and it has been known to require almost    iterations to obtain a convergence  if anyone is so inclined  that person would be free to create a program for piston and or jet pumps using the equations attached to this document  for jet pumps  loss coefficients are needed  nozzle  throat and diffuser  for the different jet pump configurations available in the industry  however  they are not part of the public domain as they are considered to be confidential information by the manufacturers  some generic loss coefficients are available  but the user is warned against assuming that they apply to any particular jet pump     general comments for jet pumps      nozzle and throat combinations        performance     the performance of a jet nozzle and throat combination is related to the size of the nozzle and the annular area between the throat and the jet stream of the nozzle       flow capacity     as the nozzle size and throat size increase  then the flow capacity increases   the larger nozzle flow area allows for a greater nozzle flow and a larger annular area allows for larger volumes of oil  water and gas to pass into the throat for the same differential pressure   the ratio of the nozzle area to the throat area equals the area ratio   as the area ratio progressively decreases  then the throat has a greater annular area for the flow of produced fluids around the nozzle  greater production rates are possible for a constant differential pressure  but less discharge head will develop due to the reduced volume of power fluid available to interact with the greater volume of produced fluid   the reverse is true for the larger ratio numbers  lower production rates occur as the throat size decreases since the annular area available for fluid flow progressively decreases  a greater discharge head will develop due the greater volume of power fluid available to interact with the reduced volume of produced fluid  in many cases the user will work to select an optimum size within a horsepower constraint  the power required depends on the nozzle size  the operating pressure  the depth of the well  and especially the pump intake pressure   in general  larger throats with a given nozzle lead to higher operating pressures because these ratios have less pressure recovery  however  when power fluid friction is significant  the use of a larger ratio may lead to lower operating pressures if the nozzle size can also be reduced   the effect of pump discharge pressure on pump performance generally results in   to   psi extra of power fluid pressure to maintain performance for every   psi increase of discharge pressure  this depends on the area ratio  with the higher ratios requiring less than the smaller ratios  the discharge pressure depends to a great deal on the gas to liquid ratio  glr  in the return column  which in turn depends on how much power fluid is mixed with the production   experience has shown that in wells deeper than about      feet tvd  the use of oil as the power fluid results in a lower injection pressure  although the use of water as a power fluid increases the pressure at the nozzle  due

 is a relatively new field  rather than being limited to assisting in the identification and delineation of prospects  geophysics is now increasingly being used for the characterization of the internal geometry and quality of reservoirs themselves and is often used as a means of monitoring reservoir changes between wells during production  advances in the reliability of seismic observations and in methods for interpreting these observations in terms of reservoir properties have  together with economic considerations  provided the driving forces for the development of reservoir geophysics  the chapter on fundamentals of geophysics in the reservoir engineering and petrophysics section of this   handbook   addresses the concepts used in seismic studies and is a useful introduction to the general topic  this chapter expands on the applications of geophysical technologies to reservoir characterization and monitoring for improved production  __toc__     overview         differences from exploration geophysics      there are several specific differences between exploration geophysics and reservoir geophysics  as the term is usually intended  the differences include  the assumption that well control is available within the area of the geophysical survey  a carefully designed geophysical survey can be conducted at a level of detail that will be useful  some understanding of the rock physics is available for interpretation   d seismic  or other geophysical  data can be collected  and geostatistical techniques can be applied to it  the reservoir geophysicist should be familiar with the usefulness and limitations of petrophysical and reservoir engineering studies and should be able to ask intelligent questions of the experts in those fields  however  the reservoir geophysicist typically is not an expert in those areas and works with the appropriate specialists to interpret the data or to design a new experiment to solve reservoir problems       well control      in exploration  extrapolation of well data from far outside the area of interest is often necessary  and the interpretation is required to cross faults  sequence boundaries  pressure compartments  and other discontinuities that may or may not be recognized  the interpreter resorts to analogs in the absence of hard data  and local calibration of the geophysical response is generally poor  in reservoir geophysics  it can often be assumed that a reservoir is already under production or at a late stage of development  therefore  wells are available for analysis  providing a variety of information  the interpreter has access to edited and interpreted well log data  descriptions of the lithology  including the mineralogy  porosity  and perhaps even the morphology of the pore spaces   and the fluid content  sometimes related to either logged conditions or virgin reservoir conditions   in addition  detailed depth constraints for geologic horizons are available  whereas exploration based seismic data is limited to estimates of time to depth conversions that are inaccurate without well ties  if a well has been tested  there may be estimates of the proximity to boundaries  aquifers  or other features of interest  if the reservoir has been under production  good estimates of the total volume of the reservoir are also available  the asset team can relate these observations to the geologic interpretation  and thereby determine the need for seismic surveys at increased resolution  additional information is usually available concerning the in situ conditions of the reservoir  including the formation temperature  pressure  and the properties of the oil gas and brine       rock physics control      reservoir geophysics studies are directed at differentiating between competing reservoir models or at developing new ones  the ability of a given study to accomplish this lies not just in the geophysical model but in the rock physics  or  quot seismic petrophysics  quot  of the reservoir rock and neighboring formationspennington  w d        seismic petrophysics   an applied science for reservoir geophysics  the leading edge               logs  particularly sonic logs of compressional and shear velocities  when combined with density logs and with image logs  can be used  carefully  to provide basic seismic properties  which are in turn modeled for variations in lithologic character  fluid content  and in situ conditions such as pore pressure  core samples can be used to provide the basis for a theoretical framework or measurements on them can be used  again  carefully  to provide the same basic seismic properties  reservoir geophysicists should always be on the alert for accidental misuse of the input data  they should also be concerned with upscaling of the properties  particularly with the possibility that physical effects occuring at one scale not be mistakenly ap

are selected to impart a predictable set of properties of the fluid  including viscosity  friction  formation compatiblity  and fluid loss control      overview     to create the fracture  a fluid is pumped into the wellbore at a high rate to increase the pressure in the wellbore at the perforations to a value greater than the breakdown pressure of the formation  the breakdown pressure is generally believed to be the sum of the in situ stress and the tensile strength of the rock  once the formation is broken down and the fracture created  the fracture can be extended at a pressure called the fracture propagation pressure  the fracture propagation pressure is equal to the sum of    the in situ stress  the net pressure drop  the near wellbore pressure drop  the net pressure drop is equal to the pressure drop down the fracture as the result of viscous fluid flow in the fracture  plus any pressure increase caused by tip effects  the near wellbore pressure drop can be a combination of the pressure drop of the viscous fluid flowing through the perforations and or the pressure drop resulting from tortuosity between the wellbore and the propagating fracture  thus  the

fluid densities will be    to     of the densities of water based fluids  foam fluid densities can be substantially less than those of water based fluids  in low pressure reservoirs  low density fluids  like foam  can be used to assist in the fluid cleanup  conversely  in certain deep reservoirs  including offshore frac pack applications   there is a need for higher density fracturing fluids

commercial gas flow rates  or recover commercial volumes of natural gas  unless a hydraulic fracture treatment is properly designed and pumped  as such  the entire drilling and completion procedures should focus on making sure the optimum fracture treatment can be designed and pumped in the field   when drilling a tight gas well  the most important aspect of the drilling operation is to drill a gauge hole  many times this means the well should be drilled at a balanced mud weight or slightly overbalanced  in other cases  air drilling or underbalanced drilling works best  as long as the hole remains in gauge  if a gauge hole is drilled  we can run openhole logs and obtain valid data that are required to properly evaluate the formation and to design the completion  if the hole is washed out and rugose  the logs are difficult or impossible to accurately evaluate  and the net gas pay is difficult to identify  also  if the borehole is in gauge  the chances of obtaining a satisfactory primary cement job on the production casing increase when compared to trying to cement casing in a washed out borehole  obtaining a good primary cement job is extremely important when completing a well in a multilayered reservoir that must be fracture treated      underbalanced drilling     some drilling personnel want to drill underbalanced in tight gas reservoirs because    the penetration rate is faster  formation invasion of mud filtrate is minimized  there is little chance of a gas kick because of the low permeability nature of the formations  however  underbalanced drilling is only acceptable if a gauge hole can be maintained  speed to reach total depth is not important if the borehole is washed out and we cannot properly evaluate the reservoir layers or obtain an adequate primary cement job  also  formation damage is not an important consideration in tight gas reservoirs  it does not matter whether or not the near wellbore formation has been damaged during drilling  in every case  we still use multiple pump trucks and pump rather large fracture treatments  the hydraulic fracture breaks through any near wellbore damage      completion strategy     to complete a tight gas well successfully  the engineer should consider the items included in    table       the ideal completion is the one that produces the most gas for the lowest cost   considering both the initial completion cost and the subsequent operating costs  this definition implies that a prudent engineer will attempt to provide a functional completion for many years to come at the lowest possible cost to the operator    file vol  page     image      png    table     data required to determine completion strategy      of concern in the design of the completion is always the number of producing zones that are separated in the reservoir by vertical flow barrier layers  to determine whether different producing intervals should actually be treated as a single reservoir  one must first determine if these various intervals are all connected by a single hydraulic fracture  if a particular zone is separated from another pay zone by a thin silt or shale layer with little in situ stress contrast among the layers  one can use a model to determine if all the zones can be connected by a single hydraulic fracture  if a single fracture treatment is used to stimulate multiple layers  and no reservoir damage occurs by commingling the different zones  the well should be completed as if all the layers are actually a single reservoir  normally  in dry gas reservoirs  no reservoir damage occurs by commingling zones  in fact  it is likely that more gas will be recovered by producing all the layers commingled because the abandonment pressure is lower at any given economic limit when the zones are commingled vs  producing the zones one at a time   if two or more productive intervals are separated by a thick  clean shale  say     ft or more  and this shale has enough in situ stress contrast to be a barrier to vertical fracture growth  the design engineer might need to design the completion and stimulation treatments to consider the fact that multiple hydraulic fractures will be created  in such cases  fracture treatment diverting techniques must be used to properly stimulate all producing intervals  more information concerning completion design in multilayered reservoirs is

penetrating the rock pores at pressures below fracture pressure  acidizing is used to either stimulate a well to improve flow or to remove damage  during matrix acidizing the acids dissolve the sediments and mud solids within the pores that are inhibiting the permeability of the rock  this process enlarges the natural pores of the reservoir which stimulates the flow of hydrocarbons  effective acidizing is guided by practical limits in volumes and types of acid and procedures so as to achieve an optimum removal of the formation damage around the wellbore      two basic acidizing treatments     acidizing is used to either stimulate a well to greater than ideal matrix reservoir flow or to remove damage  these are two distinct and different purposes  the field applications and results of which are often merged or confused  basically  there are two types of acid treatments that are related to injection rates and pressures  injection rates resulting in pressures below fracture pressure are termed  quot matrix acidizing  quot  while those above fracture pressure are termed  quot fracture acidizing  quot      fig       shows the increase in pressure linearly with rate until parting pressure is attained  at which time rate can continue to increase with little change in pressure above parting pressure  matrix acidizing is used primarily for damage removal  while fracture acidizing is used to enlarge the effective wellbore by creating an acid etched fracture deep into the wellbore for relatively low permeability formations to improve well productivity several

removing damage around the wellbore  thus improving productivity in both sandstone and carbonate wells  although the acid systems used in sandstone and carbonate differ  the same practices apply to both  in the absence of damage  the large volume of acid that is required to improve the formation permeability in the vicinity of the wellbore may not justify the small incremental increase in production  especially in sandstone  in carbonate rock  hydrochloric acid enlarges the wellbore or tends to bypass damage by forming wormholes  the permeability increase is much larger in carbonate than in sandstone  the effect of damage on well productivity and flow is illustrated in    figs    and      mcleod  h o        matrix acidizing to improve well performance  short course manual

  are recommended for the decreasing injection gas pressure installation design method  valves with a small   f    p    under      are sensitive primarily to a change in the injection gas pressure  a decrease in the surface operating injection gas pressure for each lower gas lift valve is essential to ensure the closure of upper unloading valves after gas injection has been established through a lower operating valve  this design is particularly applicable when the available injection gas pressure is high relative to the required depth of lift and an additional incremental decrease in injection gas pressure can be added between valves   if gas lift valves with large ports are required to pass sufficient gas rates for unloading and lifting a well  the design that incorporates valve performance should be used  generally  if the operating valve is not near the packer  the calculated point of gas injection will be bracketed by installing at least one valve below the calculated operating valve depth in the event there is a slight error in the well information or a change in well conditions      constant decrease in the operating injection gas pressure for each succeeding lower gas lift valve     this installation design method  following api  is based on all gas lift valves having the same port size and a constant decrease in the operating injection gas pressure for each succeeding lower gas lift valve  the gas lift valve selection must be based on a port size that allows the injection gas throughput required for unloading and gas lifting the well  this installation design method is recommended for gas lift valves with a small production pressure factor  when the ratio of the port area to the bellows area is low  the decrease in the injection gas pressure between gas lift valves  based on the additional tubing effect pressure for the top valve  is not excessive  the effect of bellows assembly load rate on the performance of the gas lift valves is not considered in the installation design calculations  safety factors included in these design calculations should allow sufficient increase in the operating injection gas pressure  which is necessary to provide the valve stem travel for adequate injection gas passage through each successively lower unloading gas lift valve without excessive interference from upper valves   selection of a constant injection gas pressure decrease  or drop  in the surface operating injection gas pressure for each succeeding lower gas lift valve should not be arbitrary  as proposed in some design methods  the pressure decrease should be based on the gas lift valve specifications to minimize the possibility of upper valves remaining open while lifting from a lower valve  the additional tubing effect pressure for the top gas lift valve is a logical choice for this decrease in the operating injection gas pressure between valves  closing or reopening of an injection pressure operated gas lift valve is partially controlled by the production pressure effect  which is equal to the production pressure factor for the valve multiplied by the difference flowing production pressure at the top valve depth   the flowing production pressure at an unloading valve depth changes from the transfer pressure     p    pfd   min  to a higher flowing production pressure after the next lower valve becomes the operating valve  the additional tubing effect pressure is the difference between    p    pfd   min and the maximum flowing production pressure  at the unloading valve depth     p    pfd   max  after the point of gas injection has transferred to this next lower valve  as the unloading gas lift valve depths increase  the distance between valves and the difference between    p    pfd   min and    p    pfd   max decrease  although the additional tubing effect pressure decreases for lower valves  the injection gas requirement for unloading increases with depth  an increased stem travel  or stroke  is usually needed for the lower valves to generate the larger equivalent port area necessary for the higher injection gas requirements with the lower pressure differentials that occur across these deeper valves  a constant decrease in the operating injection gas pressure equal to the additional tubing effect pressure fo

rock characteristics  continued technological advances have provided improved methods for analyzing the measurements of natural and induced nuclear readings  even with better tool designs  the long standing problem remains that logging tools do not directly measure the formation properties that engineers  geologists  and petrophysicists need to describe a reservoir  the goal of log analysis is to map out the downhole values of reservoir characteristics chiefly as porosity  fluid saturations  and permeability  unfortunately  nuclear logging tools only measure gamma ray or neutron count rates at cleverly positioned detectors  inference  empiricism  experience  and alibis bridge these count rates to the rocks and fluids in the reservoir  nuclear log interpretation rests on smarter processing of these tool readings  understanding what the tools really measure is the key to better log analysis  this article gives an overview of nuclear logging and how they measure the transport

physics highlights the blurry relationship between what they measure and what we expect from them     table      summarizes such a classification scheme  two types of problems skew tool measurements away from their targets    because a nuclear tool averages over a shallow bulk volume  the borehole often represents a major part of the tool   s response   even if all borehole effects can be removed  the fact remains that nuclear tools do not respond directly to reservoir properties   sometimes  the reservoir parameter of interest does not even dominate the underlying physics of the tool  historically  such problems have been addressed with calibrations at a few points accessible in the laboratory  these are then generalized into correction charts  two bookshearst  j r   nelson  p h

are penetrating radiation  unlike visible light  they can traverse tool housings and boreholes and still sample a significant volume of the formation  they can even penetrate casing  giving them a near monopoly in cased hole formation evaluation  they also respond to different properties than resistivity logs  which merely measure the conductivity of a formation   to exploit a reservoir  the

knowledge of rock fabric  one of the primary uses of nuclear logs  rock fabric information runs the gamut from primary lithology  e g   sandstone vs  limestone  to diagenesis to clay volume and distribution  nuclear logs can provide estimates of bulk formation properties such as density and hydrogen content  with some geologic insight and simplifications  these bulk properties can be related to reservoir fabric through simple bulk mixing laws  one of the virtues of nuclear tools is that they are bulk averaging devices  they average formation properties over a volume on the order of   ft   while nuclear logs are much less sensitive to the difference between water and liquid hydrocarbons than resistivity logs  they are very sensitive to the difference between liquid  and gas phase fluids

the fluids to the surface after reservoir pressure is no longer sufficient to do so  the key component of a hydraulic pumping operation is the downhole pump  the two basic types of installations are the    fixed    pump and the    free    pump design  in the fixed installation  the downhole pump is attached to the end of a tubing string and run into the well  free pump installations are designed to allow the downhole pump to be circulated into and out of the well inside the power fluid string  or it can also be installed and retrieved by wireline operations      fixed pump installations     in the fixed insert  or tubing conveyed  design  the pump typically lands on a seating shoe in the larger tubing  power fluid is normally directed down the inner tubing string  and the produced fluids and return power fluid flow to the surface inside the annulus between the two tubing strings  as shown in part a of    fig        these systems provide a passage for free gas in the annular space between the outer tubing string and the inside of the well casing  but to take full advantage of this gas venting passage  the pump should be set below the perforations  the power fluid string is usually    in     in   or     in  nominal tubing or   in       in  or     in  coiled tubing  the fixed pump system is used mainly to fit a large diameter downhole pump into restricted casing sizes and still retain the gas vent feature  it also can be used to lift one or both zones of a dual well with parallel strings    file vol  page     image      png    fig    free and fixed hydraulic downhole pumping installations       back to top  in the fixed casing design  the tubing with the pump attached to its lower end is seated on a packer  as shown in part b of    fig        with this configuration  the power fluid is directed down the tubing string  and the mixed power fluid and the produced well fluids return to the surface in the tubing casing annulus  because the well fluids enter the pump from below a packer  the pump must handle all the free gas  this type of installation is normally used with large diameter high capacity pumps in wells with little free gas  and if space permits  a gas vent string can be run from below the packer to the surface  as with the fixed insert design  this installation is no longer common  and both have been largely supplanted by the various free pump installations  note that in both of the fixed type installations  when using a reciprocating piston pump  the power fluid mixes with the produced fluid after passing through the pump      free pump installations     the free pump feature is one of the most significant advantages of hydraulic pumping systems  free pump installations permit circulating the pump to the bottom  producing the well  and circulating the pump back to the surface for repair or size change     fig       shows pump in and out operations for a typical free pump installation  they require that a bottomhole assembly  bha  be run in on the tubing string  the bha consists of a seating shoe and one or more sealbores above it and serves as a receptacle for the pump itself  bhas are of robust construction and use corrosion resistant sealing bores to ensure a long life in the downhole environmental conditions  the extensions needed on the bha also can be adapted with different metallurgy to accommodate a changing environment  once run in on the tubing string  the bha normally remains in place for years  even though the downhole pump may be circulated in and out numerous times for repair or resizing  as shown in    fig        a wireline retrievable standing valve is landed in the seating shoe below the pump  the pump is run in the hole by placing it in the power fluid string and pumping fluid down the tubing  when the pump reaches bottom  it enters the sealbores  begins stroking or jetting  and opens the standing valve  during normal pumping  this valve is held open by well fluid drawn into the pump suction  during pump out  the normal flow of fluids is reversed at the surface with appropriate valving and pressure applied to the discharge flow path of the pump  this reversal of flow closes the standing valve and permits the pump to be circulated to the surface   a process that normally takes    minutes to   hours  depending on depth  tubing size  and the circulating flow rate    file vol  page     image      png    fig    free pump  pump in and out operation       file vol  page     image      png    fig    hydraulic wireline retrievable standing

mechanical displacement  or deformation  deformation of the sensing element is then converted into an electrical signal that is processed by the measuring system  types of pressure transducers available in the field  either individually or in combination  are mechanical  capacitance  strain gauge and quartz gauge  this article discusses how each of these types of pressure transducers operate      mechanical pressure transducers     the first pressure transducers had mechanical force summing elements that converted energy into mechanical displacement  or deformation  and then coupled the generated force to a recording device  in the amerada gauge  a popular mechanical pressure transducer  the pressure sensing element is a helical bourdon tube  the tube is of sufficient length to rotate a clock driven stylus a full circumference inside the cylindrical chart holder  the chart  usually made of coated metal  is recovered at the end of the test  unfolded until flat  and read on a high precision optical machine  the transducer also incorporates a vapor type recording thermometer to make temperature corrections on the pressure measurements   mechanical transducers have largely been abandoned because of their obsolete metrological characteristics and lack of surface readout  sro   they are still used occasionally for basic applications at the lower end of the economic spectrum  for some very high temperature applications  or as backup for an electronic pressure gauge      capacitance pressure transducers     capacitance transducers have a variable gap capacitor in which the sensing element is formed by two metallic or quartz plates  as the external pressure increases  the deflection of the sensing plate creates a change in the capacitance that can be mathematically related to the applied pressure       advantages of capacitance transducers      capacitance transducers have the advantages of    good frequency response  low hysteresis  good linearity  excellent stability and repeatability      disadvantages of capacitance transducers      the disadvantages are    high sensitivity to temperature  acceleration  orientation  mechanical noise  fused quartz has excellent elastic behavior  low hysteresis  and is chemically inert  these properties make it an almost ideal material for manufacturing small capacitor modules with a high temperature rating      strain pressure transducers     many types of strain gauge transducers are in use  strain gauges have become very popular because of their ruggedness  low cost  and good dynamic behavior  their metrological characteristics have greatly improved in recent years  gauges with an accuracy of a few psi and resolution as low as      psi are available  the primary limitation of strain gauges is their tendency to drift  although that aspect of the measurement has improved   a strain gauge has a strain sensitive resistor directly attached to a measuring sensor  when the sensor is subjected to pressure  it deforms  the resulting displacement changes the resistor length  hence its resistance  the applied pressure is calculated from a calibrated relationship to the

increases droplets  dissolves paraffin crystals  and increases density between oil and water      viscosity ranges     crude oil emulsions with similar viscosity ranges do not always require the same type of treating equipment or the same treating temperature  emulsions that are produced from different wells on the same lease or from the same formation in the same field might require different treating temperatures  for this reason  treating temperatures should be tested so that the lowest practical treating temperature for each emulsion and treating unit or system can be determined by trial      free water     the heat input and thus the fuel required for treating depends on the temperature rise  the amount of water in the oil  and the flow rate  because heating a given volume of water requires approximately twice the energy needed to heat the same volume of oil  it is beneficial to separate free water from the emulsion to be treated  often this is done in a separate free

demulsifiers  are chemical compounds that are widely used to destabilize  and assist in coalescence of  crude oil emulsions  this treatment method is popular because the chemicals are easily applied  usually are reasonable in cost  and usually minimize the amount of heat and settling time required   the chemical counteracts the emulsifying agent  allowing the dispersed droplets of the emulsion to coalesce into larger drops and settle out of the matrix  to work  demulsifiers    must be injected into the emulsion  must mix intimately with the emulsion and migrate to all the protective films surrounding all the dispersed droplets  must displace or nullify the effect of the emulsifying agent at the interface  for the oil and water to separate  there must also be a period of continual  moderate agitation of the treated emulsion to produce contact between and coalescence of the dispersed droplets  as well as a quiet settling period   one way to help disperse the chemical throughout the emulsion is to mix a small volume of chemical with a diluent and then to inject and mix the diluted chemical with the emulsion  the larger volume of the mixture can help to mix the chemical more uniformly and intimately with the emulsion       when injection is not recommended      usually  the chemical is injected into a coupling that is welded in the side of the pipe  but when flow rates

batch treatment method normally is used as an emergency measure      chemical measurements     using too much treating chemical not only wastes the money spent on its purchase  handling  and injection  but also can increase the stability of the water in oil emulsion or of the oil in water emulsion in the produced water and increase the stability or the volume of the interfacial emulsion and or

sized to provide enough retention time to allow gas bubbles to form and separate out      separator design basics     separators are typically sized by the droplet settling theory or retention time

instrumentation and safety systems  solids removal systems  mixing devices  level controllers and gauges  as well as  water in oil detectors      power supplies         transformers      transformers used in dehydrator and desalter power supplies must be capable of sustaining a short circuited output without damage or overheating  this protection normally is derived by including a saturable core reactor sized commensurately to the reactance of the transformer winding in series with the primary winding of the transformer  as the primary current increases  the voltage drop across the reactor increases  therefore  failures in the vessel electrical components or process upsets causing high conductivity will not damage the transformer  transformers in this service also experience high mechanical stresses from rapidly fluctuating loads and must be constructed with cores and windings that are mechanically solid and highly resistant to vibration       controllers      a weakness of electrostatic coalescers has been their means of protecting the electrical system in the event of excessive power requirements during short term upsets  unfortunately  the reactor based protection scheme described above effectively reduces power input to the vessel precisely when it is most needed   to counteract this  an electronic controller was developed that can sense the load demand and modify the power input to the transformer  this voltage controller differs from the reactor in that it reduces power on the basis of time rather than by uniformly diminishing output  short bursts of high intensity energy are applied to the emulsion  and the duration of the pulses is limited to maintain an average power output within the rating of the transformer  this action continues to provide coalescing energy even during times of process upset   the voltage controller also assists with the necessary compromise between field strength required for adequate translation of small drops and field strength sufficient to produce subdivision of large drops  as drop size increases and the surface to bulk ratio decreases  surface tension becomes unable to maintain rigidity of the drop  and viscous drag on the moving drop causes deformation  as velocity or drop size increases  this deformation  in concert with electrically induced perturbations  becomes sufficient to cause the drop to shatter  at any given field strength  there is a range of stable drop sizes that is limited at the lower end by the ability of the field to transport the drop  and at the upper end by what drop size can be transported without shattering  an ideal arrangement would be a field with a high intensity zone for coalescence of very small drops  followed by gradually decreasing field strength for shifting the equilibrium drop size range to large values  to accomplish this  the controller varies the transformer output voltage to create time based field decay  in addition to providing optimum field strength for coalescence of a wide range of drop sizes  the controller also can be used to provide high intensity fields that are suitable for both mixing  in the case of counterflow desalters  and dehydration      insulators         entrance bushings      entrance bushings are insulated pressure sealing devices that conduct high voltage into the desalter vessel  bushings are constructed of perfluorocarbon because of its superior resistance to fouling by foreign substances such as suspended solids or precipitated organic materials  if such materials collect on the surface of the insulator  a resistive electrical path will form that will conduct a small current and produce localized heating  this heating can cause the formation of a carbonized track along the insulator surface that ultimately will cause insulator failure  the perfluorocarbon portion of the bushings must remain submerged during operation to avoid plasma erosion of the insulator material       electrode

becomes prohibitively high  the industry has found that surface facilities must be kept to a minimum and shared by satellite fields to be commercial  subsea processing is a key toward a cost effective     hub and spoke    development     fig         allowing the industry to operate successfully in deeper water     file vol  page     image      png    fig      spar hub and spoke concept         advantages of subsea processing   subsea processing refers to the separation of produced fluids into gas and liquid   or gas  oil  and water   for individual phase transport and disposal  in the case of water   the liquid stream can be pumped to a central facility for final processing  the gas stream can be transported under natural pressure or pressure boosted  compressed  to the host facility    the current practice is to flow produced fluids from subsea wells directly back to a central surface processing facility in multiphase  gas  oil  and water  pipelines  known as a    subsea tieback    field development  because reservoir pressure is the only source of energy to overcome all the impediments to flow  e g   pressure drop through the formation  wellbore  tubing  friction and static head   tree  flowline  and so on  well productivity for normally pressured reservoirs tends to be low  and the    tieback    distance is typically limited to less than    miles  in addition  multiphase pipelines potentially have many flow assurance problems  like   fluid slugging  hydrate formation  wax deposition  solids dropout   subsea processing offers a technical solution to many of these problems  it can accomplish the following     improve well productivity with greater pressure drawdown    increase ultimate recovery by extending economic life    eliminate fluid surges by use of single phase pipelines    avoid gas hydrates with no inhibition or with reduced inhibitor dosage    prevent solids dropout by allowing higher liquid flow velocities    allow online pigging to control wax deposition in oil pipelines    reduce capital and operating costs by reducing surface processing needs     improved reservoir productivity    a key benefit of subsea processing  separation and liquid pumping  is greater pressure drawdown  which results in higher production rates and greater oil and gas recovery  separating the produced fluids on the seabed allows the liquid to be pressure boosted with an efficient conventional mechanical pump  single phase pumping overcomes the static backpressure of the fluid column from the seafloor to the surface  and it avoids the excessive pressure drop and surges of multiphase flow    as illustrated in    figs     left  and    right      for a typical deepwater development in       ft of water  flowing tubing pressure at the seabed may be       psi  even with a separator inlet pressure of only     psi on the platform  much of the       psi pressure drop takes place because of hydrostatic head of the fluid  gas and liquid  column  if the separator can be located at the seabed  a significant portion of the       psi can be used as additional reservoir pressure drawdown  assuming a modest productivity index  pi  of   bbl psi  a production increase of       b d per well may be realized  as reservoir pressure declines  reduced backpressure may extend the productive life of the field and increase ultimate hydrocarbon recovery  because productivity and reserves recovered per well are key to field economics  use of subsea processing can greatly enhance the value of some deepwater developments     file vol  page     image      png    fig      subsea separation and pumping application in typical deepwater developments         deepwater and long distance tiebacks    subsea processing moves the productivity limiting influences to the seabed and decouples the reservoir development from water depth  the source of flowing tubing pressure drop is only between the wellbore and seabed  rather than all the way up to the platform elevation  this has greater impact as production advances into deeper water  especially for shallow  low pressure reservoirs in deep water  similarly  the pressure boosting benefits of subsea processing will enable longer distances from the subsea tieback to a host platform  most direct subsea tiebacks are limited to approximately    miles because of available flow energy from the reservoir    with subsea separation and liquid pumping  most of the energy required to transport the produced fluid is supplied by mechanical means rather than totally by reservoir pressure  subsea liquid pumps are currently available for most applications  separator gas can flow long distances under natural pressure  as advances are made into large capacity subsea power supply and compressor systems  subsea gas compression will become another viable option  enabling smaller pipeline size and even longer transport

costs because of excessive machine downtime to replace broken saw blades that overheat  warp  and break   the single slot staggered  longitudinal pattern is generally preferred because the strength of the unslotted pipe is preserved  the staggered pattern also gives a more uniform distribution of slots over the surface area of the pipe  the single slot staggered pattern is slotted with an even

the outside surface of the pipe than on the inside  slots formed in this way have an inverted    v    cross sectional area and are less prone to plugging because any particle passing through the slot

wrapped and welded to longitudinal rods to form a single helical slot with any desired width  the jacket is subsequently placed over and welded at each end to a supporting pipe base  containing drilled holes  to provide structural support  this is a standard commodity design manufactured by several companies  a schematic of the screen construction is shown in    fig        screen tolerances

contains produced fluids and pressures within the wellbore to protect the casing and other formations above or below the producing zone  this is essential to the basic functioning of most wells      uses of packers     in addition to providing a seal between the tubing and casing  other benefits of a packer are as follows    prevent downhole movement of the tubing string  support some of the weight of the tubing  often improve well flow and production rate  protect the annular casing from corrosion from produced fluids and high pressures  provide a means of separation of multiple producing zones  limit well control to the tubing at the surface for safety purposes  hold well servicing fluid  kill fluids  packer fluids  in the casing annulus      packer components     packers have four key features    slip  cone  packing element system  body or mandrel   the slip is a wedge shaped device with wickers  or teeth  on its face  which penetrate and grip the casing wall when the packer is set  the cone is beveled to match the back of the slip and forms a ramp that drives the slip outward and into the casing wall when setting force is applied to the packer  once the slips have anchored into the casing wall  additional applied setting force energizes the packing element system and creates a seal between the packer body and the inside diameter of the casing      packer classification     production packers can be classified into two groups    retrievable  permanent       permanent packers      permanent packers can be removed from the wellbore only by milling  the retrievable packer may or may not be resettable  but removal from the wellbore normally does not require milling  retrieval is usually accomplished by some form of tubing manipulation  this may necessitate rotation or require pulling tension on the tubing string   the permanent packer is fairly simple and generally offers higher performance in both temperature and pressure ratings than does the retrievable packer  in most instances  it has a smaller outside diameter  od   offering greater running clearance inside the casing string than do retrievable packers  the smaller od and the compact design of the permanent packer help the tool negotiate through tight spots and deviations in the wellbore  the permanent packer also offers the largest inside diameter  id  to make it compatible with larger diameter tubing strings and monobore completions       retrievable packers      the retrievable packer can be very basic for low pressure low temperature  lp lt  applications or very complex in high pressure high temperature  hp ht  applications  because of this design complexity in high end tools  a retrievable packer offering performance levels similar to those of a permanent packer will invariably cost more  however  the ease of removing the packer from the wellbore as well as features  such as resettability and being able to reuse the packer often  may outweigh the added cost       packer selection      before selecting either tool  it is important to consider the performance and features of each design  as well as the application in which it will be used  perhaps in some instances  the permanent packer is the only option  as may be the case in some hp ht applications  however  in those instances in which either will suffice  the operator must decide which features offer the best return over the life of the well   when selecting a packer for a cased hole completion  the differential pressure and temperature requirements of the application must be considered  the well depth  deployment and setting method desired  and final tubing landing conditions are also factors that come into play  the various operational modes  flowing  shut in  injection  and stimulation  that are anticipated over the life of the well are critical and must be considered carefully in the design phase  the changes in the operational modes that influence changes in temperature  differential pressure  and axial loads all have a direct impact on the packer  understanding the uses and constraints of the different types of packers will help clarify the factors to consider when making a selection      types of packers         retrievable tension packer      the tension packer     fig        is typically used in medium  to shallow depth  lp lt  production or injection applications  the tension packer has a single set of unidirectional slips that grip only the casing when the tubing is pulled in tension  constant tubing tension must be maintained to keep the packer set and the packing element energized  tension packers  typically  are set mechanically and are released by means of tubing rotation  most models also have an emergency shear release feature should the primary release method fail    file vol prt page     image      png    fig      tension packer       the tension packer does

transported  and stored in a        c refrigerator  core plugs should be taken in a cold room and allowed to warm only under confining stress   logging parameters are not affected by expansion because

operations because they begin after pressure depletion  however  if water injection takes place before the end of pressure depletion  which is not uncommon  it is considered a pressure maintenance

of water  the water used for injection typically is produced from the target well before the test and stored in tanks on the surface  during production  the amount of gas dissolved in the water    r    sw    that is produced from the formation is measured   the injected water is essentially free of dissolved hydrocarbon gases  i e   it is  quot dead quot    as the injected water enters the formation that contains residual gas  the water dissolves the gas  becoming saturated at the temperature and pressure in the reservoir  a region of increasing radius around the wellbore is stripped of gas  injection continues until a volume    v    i    has entered the formation  a material balance tracer such as methanol is added to all injected water   at the end of the injection  the stripped region near the well is a volume of pore space that is filled with dead water    v    d     just beyond this dead water zone  the pore space contains the original gas saturation and gas saturated injected water   immediately after injection  water is produced back from the formation through the well to the surface  the first volume of water produced is the   v    d   from the leached region  and so contains no dissolved gas  this dead water is followed by gas saturated water from the region outside the stripped zone  the gas saturated water is able to move through the stripped region without giving up its dissolved gas to reform the original gas saturation  this nonreversing behavior is the reason the method works in a single well      calculating residual gas saturation     after

analysis     the modified isochronal test     fig        is conducted like an isochronal test  except the shut in periods are of equal duration  the shut in periods should equal or exceed the length of the flow periods  because the well does not build up to average reservoir pressure after each flow period  the shut in sandface pressures recorded immediately before each flow period rather than the average reservoir pressure are used in the test analysis  as a result  the modified isochronal test is less accurate than the isochronal test  as the duration of the shut in periods increases  the accuracy of the modified isochronal test also increases  again  a final stabilized flow point usually is obtained at the end of the test but is not required for analyzing the test data    file vol

like those from an isochronal test   the theory developed for the modified isochronal test implies that  if the intuitive approximation of using   p    ws   instead of   p    s   is valid  the

equipment  artificial lift equipment   file vol  page     image      png    fig      production system and associated pressure losses       the reservoir is the source of fluids for the production system  it is the porous  permeable media in which the reservoir fluids are stored and through which the fluids will flow to the wellbore  it also furnishes the primary energy for the production system  the wellbore serves as the conduit for access to the reservoir from the surface  it is composed of the drilled wellbore  which normally has been cemented and cased  the cased wellbore houses the tubing and associated subsurface production equipment  such as packers  the tubing serves as the primary conduit for fluid flow from the reservoir to the surface  although fluids also may be transported through the tubing casing annulus   the wellhead  flowlines  and processing equipment represent the surface mechanical equipment required to control and process reservoir fluids at the surface and prepare them for transfer to a purchaser  surface mechanical equipment includes the wellhead equipment and associated    valving  chokes  manifolds  flowlines  separators  treatment equipment  metering devices  storage vessels  in many cases  the reservoir is unable to furnish sufficient energy to produce fluids to the surface at economic rates throughout the life of the reservoir  when this occurs  artificial lift equipment is used to enhance production rates by adding energy to the production system  this component of the system is composed of both surface and subsurface elements  this additional energy can be furnished directly to the fluid through subsurface pumps  by reducing the backpressure at the reservoir with surface compression equipment to lower wellhead pressure  or by injecting gas into the production string to reduce the flowing gradient of the fluid      flow through production system     recognizing the various components of the production system and understanding their interaction generally leads to improved well productivity through analysis of the entire system  as the fluid flows from the reservoir into and through the production system  it experiences a continuous pressure drop  as    fig       shows   the pressure begins at the average reservoir pressure and ends either at the pressure of the transfer line or near atmospheric pressure in the stock tank  in either case  a large pressure drop is experienced as the reservoir fluids are produced to the surface  it is the petroleum engineer   s responsibility to use this pressure reduction in an optimal manner  the pressure reduction depends on the production rate and  at the same time  the production rate depends on the pressure change  understanding the relationship between pressure and production rate is important to predicting the performance of individual oil and gas wells   to design a well completion or predict the production rate properly  a systematic approach is required to integrate the production system components  systems analysis  more commonly called nodal analysis   which allows the petroleum engineer to both analyze production systems and design well completions  accomplishes this  for proper management of the well and reservoir it is critical to understand the flow of reservoir fluids through the production system  particularly inflow performance  which is the reservoir pressure rate behavior of the individual well  and outflow performance  which is the flow of reservoir fluids through the piping system   systems analysis is an excellent engineering tool for optimizing the design of a new well completion or analyzing the behavior of a current production system  the application of systems analysis requires a thorough understanding of the relationship between flow of reservoir fluids in the subsurface reservoir and fluid flow through the well completion and tubulars to the surface stock tank  unfortunately  this understanding is often lacking in practice  inefficient operations may occur  because the petroleum engineer does not have a complete understanding

no longer extends to the pure component   side of the diagram  instead  there is a critical point    c    at which liquid and vapor phases are identical  the critical point occurs at the maximum pressure of the two phase region  the volumetric behavior of mixtures containing less component   than the critical mixture    x    c    is like that shown in    fig           fig       shows the volumetric behavior of mixtures containing more component    compression of the mixture of composition   x     in fig     leads to the appearance of liquid phase of composition   x    when pressure   p    d    is reached  the volume of liquid first grows and then declines with increasing pressure  the liquid phase disappears again when pressure   p    d    is reached  such behavior is called  quot

principle     the chamber lift principle implies that the injection gas initially contacts the top of the liquid column in the chamber and displaces this liquid into the tubing above the chamber before injection gas enters the lower end of the dip tube  the dip tube is assumed to be filled with liquid at the beginning of an injection gas cycle  that is  the top of the chamber is located at the working fluid level  the accumulated liquid in the chamber annulus is u tubed into the tubing above the chamber before injection gas entry into the lower end of the dip tube  chamber lift operation prevents water accumulation in the production conduit because the water is u tubed first from the chamber  followed by the oil  and then by the injection gas      design considerations and chamber length     the chamber length should be calculated on the basis of an injection gas pressure that is    to     of the initial opening pressure of the chamber operating gas lift valve to ensure adequate pressure differential across the liquid column at the instant the injection gas enters the lower end of the dip tube  actual operations have shown higher chamber lift efficiency when the chamber length is based on an injection gas pressure that is at least    to    of the opening pressure of the chamber operating gas lift valve  an adequate pressure differential across the liquid slug

the mass flow rate into the system is positive  whereas flow rates out of the system to the surroundings are negative    mass can carry internal energy into or out of the system  we neglect kinetic and potential energy carried by the mass  this is often a good assumption when the fluid is not moving near the speed of sound  the change in height over the system is not large  or the system temperature variations are not large    the only types of work that are present are expansion compression of the system and flow work  the boundaries of the system can expand or contract  thus  work can be done by the system on the surroundings or vice versa  work is positive when the surroundings do work on the system  i e   the system contracts   the mass that enters or exits the system also does work   sometimes called flow work or pressure work    we neglect potential energy and kinetic energy changes within the system    energy in the form of heat might enter or leave the system across

probabilistic models  the latter have their associated pitfalls as well  adding uncertainty  by replacing single estimate inputs with probability distributions  requires the user to exercise caution on several fronts  without going into exhaustive detail we offer a couple of illustrations      key differences with probabilistic models     first  the probabilistic model is more complicated  it demands more documentation and more attention to logical structure  in particular  each iteration of a monte carlo model should be a plausible realization  the purpose of using a range of values for each input is to acknowledge the realm of possibilities  thus  once each of the input distributions is sampled  the resulting case should be sensible  something an expert would agree is possible   second  our criticism of the classical sensitivity analysis procedures  tornado charts and spider diagrams  included the notion that some of the inputs would not be independent  thus  our probabilistic model should address any relationships between variables  which typically are handled by imposing correlation between pairs of input distributions  each of these coefficients requires a value between      and     it is the model builder   s responsibility to assign and justify these values  which may be based on historical data or experience      data availability and usefulness     probabilistic models rely on sensible choices of input distributions     garbage in garbage out    is an often heard complaint of skeptics and bears acknowledging  while it is true of any model that the results are only as good as the inputs  monte carlo models seem to draw more criticism about this aspect  harbaugh et al harbaugh  j   davis  j   and wendebourg  j        computing risk for oil prospects  new york city  pergamon press   take an extreme position  arguing that one cannot do uncertainty analysis without adequate analogous data  one consultant specializing in monte carlo simulation takes another view when he tells his clients     i don   t want to see any data  instead  i want to build the model first  then do sensitivity analysis and find out what kind of data we really need to start collecting     somewhere between these extremes lies a sensible position of relying on    experience     i have had the opportunity to study data for this parameter in the past  and while i have no legitimate offset data  i know that under these circumstances the average net pay is slightly skewed right and has a coefficient of variation of about           fundamental principles     this input can be viewed as an aggregation  so its distribution must be approximately normal       appropriate data to form estimates of inputs to a model   a related problem arises when the data available is simply not appropriate  it is common to collect data from different populations  lumping porosities from different facies  drilling penetration rates at different depths  and for prices in different seasons  sometimes  simply plotting a histogram of the empirical data reveals bimodal behavior  almost always a sign of mixing samples from different populations  naturally  data used as a basis for building a distribution should be vetted for measurement and clerical errors  however  one should be wary of tossing out extreme values to make the data look more like a familiar distribution  rather  one should try to determine how the extreme values came about  they may be your best samples   novices always want to know how many data are necessary before one can reliably build a distribution based on them  this is not a simple matter  you may find a quick answer in a statistics text about significance  but in our world  we often do not have an adequate number of samples for statistical significance  and yet we must work the problem  the question comes down to how many points you need to build a    sensible    histogram  curve fitting software does not work very well with fewer than    points  rather than relying on some automatic process  one should use common sense and experience  among other things  one can often guess the distribution type  at least whether it is symmetric or the direction of skewness  and then look to use the minimum and maximum values for p   and p   or p  and p   as a starting point      level of detail     often  a problem can be analyzed at various levels of detail  cost models are a good case in point  in one large gulf of mexico deepwater billion dollar development  the monte carlo model had       line items  another client built a high level cost estimate for construction of a floating  production  storage  and offloading  fpso  vessel with only    items  production forecasts for fields can be done at a single well level  then aggregated or simply done as a single forecast with a pattern of ramp up then plateau  followed by decline  cash flow m

appropriate ignition method depends on the reservoir and the equipment available on site   downhole gas fired burners allow good control of the temperature of injected gases and may be operated at a greater depth than other methods  the disadvantages include the need to run multiple tubing strings in the injection wells  some particulates such as soot may be carried into the formation if the gas does not burn cleanly   catalytic heaters run at lower temperatures but are sometimes prohibitively expensive  electrical heaters can be lowered with a single cable  can provide excellent temperature control  and can be reused repeatedly  there is  however  a depth limitation because of electrical power losses in the cable   chemically enhanced ignition does not have a depth limitation but may require handling and storage of dangerous materials  fuel packs are not recommended because of poor temperature control and nonuniform ignition across the entire reservoir thickness  well damage from elevated temperatures and plugging by particulate matter may occur   steam may be used to locally increase reservoir temperature and facilitate auto ignition  it suffers from depth limitation because of wellbore heat losses  but when the conditions are right  it can be a very simple and effective method for ignition      well design and completions     wells used in in situ combustion must be

reservoir  one must first be assured that the core measurements are appropriate for reservoir conditions  sample collection  selection  and preparation are important steps in ensuring that the data set represents the geology at in situ conditions  some precautions are discussed in relative permeability and capillary pressure  adjustments may be necessary for the type of test fluid and for pressure effects      klinkenberg effect     the permeability of a sample to a gas varies with the molecular weight of the gas and the applied pressure  as a consequence of gas slippage at the pore

 from this  the segment densities and an average density are obtained  a coarse image of the borehole can be obtained when beds of varying density arrive in one segment before another  azimuthal

rapid sampling  in this method  statistical techniques are applied to rapid samples taken on incoming gamma counts  when the tool is rotating and there is a significant difference between mud weight

processing is required to strip out the gamma ray counts that show up as low height pulses  the detector absorbs essentially all incident thermal neutrons  resulting in a high counting efficiency  but the metal hatch over the detector acts as a filter  giving a substantial epithermal character to the response  which lies somewhere between the thermal and epithermal responses of a wireline tool  in another novel approach  multiple geiger marsden tubes arrayed around the circumference of the collar detect capture gamma rays  in principle  most detected gamma rays come not from neutron capture in the formation  but from capture in the iron of the collar  they thus reflect the neutron population near the detector as if they were neutron detectors  in practice  this tool can exhibit lithology and salinity effects  in formations containing siderite  some correlation between porosity and grain density has been observed from this design  this indicates that some of the gamma rays recorded by the detector do indeed come from the formation  a third design takes a wireline like approach  the primary measurement uses banks of he

mechanisms for sand are compact growth of the remolded zone as a cylindrical  or spherical or ellipsoidal  body or extension of an anastomosing piping channel system comprising a network of tubes     wormholes      these lead to different geometries in situ  although the impact on well productivity may not be quantifiable through measurements      uniform remolded zone growth concepts        fig       shows a compact zone growth hypothesis for chops  in compact growth  the ratio of the area of the fully yielded zone to the volume enclosed approaches a minimum because a cylindrical or elliptical shape is spatially more compact than a channel network  discrete zonal boundaries do not really exist  a gradual phase transition zone develops  although it may be treated mathematically as a thin front  just as in a melting alloy  the complex and diffuse boundary shape is approximated by a geometrically regular shape and a distinct liquefaction front  a circular  d assumption is simplest for analysis because the radius of the zone and  hence  the pressure gradient can be scaled directly to sand production volume with no additional assumptions  also  overburden stress      v    plays a dominant role in the destabilizing and dilation process  and a  d model cannot capture this process in a rigorous manner    file vol  page     image      png    fig    compact zone growth hypothesis for chops     there are arguments that support a compact growth hypothesis  the yielded zones can support little overburden stress  therefore      v   must be redistributed outward from the wellbore region  see stress changes during chops   however  the overburden has elasticity and cannot strain into a sharply bent shape or complex curve  it behaves like a thick  stiff beam to smooth and homogenize deformations  outward extensions of the disturbed zone will shed     v   as they yield  whereas stiffer  inward protruding intact zones will attract     v       fig       illustrates how stress concentrations tend to lead to a compact zone  a high stress concentration cannot be sustained by an unconsolidated sandstone  ucss   shear  dilation  and softening will occur and     v   will be cast outward  the overburden stiffness causes     v   to be smoothed by shedding stress to the periphery of the yielded zones     fig       cross sections   extending this argument to three dimensions  it can be deduced that deformation smoothness is  quot enforced quot  by the stiff overburden beam  generating homogenization of yield within a compact growth zone  this keeps the boundary approximately circular to elliptic and suppresses fingering of plastic flow zones    file vol  page     image      png    fig    stress transfer and yield propagation tend to focus vertical stresses on any protruding intact zones  this causes them to yield  smoothing out deformations and stresses  leading to a more uniform compact  yielded zone growth  as fig    shows      the surface area in compact growth is minimized because forming compact shapes requires less energy than forming fingered boundaries  for a    m thick reservoir that has produced     m  of sand  the disturbed zone volume may be approximately       to        m        ratio  with a mean radius of approximately    to    m and a minimum surface area of approximately     m   any frontal perturbations  but particularly channel growth  will increase this area and are  therefore  less probable      piping channel  wormhole  growth concepts     piping channels are assumed to be stable structures  approximately cylindrical  and of constant cross sectional area along their length  diameter of approximately    to    mm   the channel is filled with slowly flowing slurry  and the tips are propagating away from the wellbore  because the size of the affected zone is influenced more by the impermeable upper and lower reservoir boundaries  cohesive shales   fluid flow will evolve from spherical to cylindrical with radial channel growth  this is analogous to reservoir drainage changes as the radius of influence increases to a value larger than the reservoir thickness   if the sand production mechanism is piping channel growth  there are two reasonable limiting cases for the channel network nature  at one extreme  a number of channels develop outward from the wellbore  and that number is constant with distance  at the other extreme  channels bifurcate and create a  d anastomosing net in which the volume density of the channels remains constant  these are limiting cases because it is difficult to envision either a decreasing number of channels with distance or an increased channel volumetric density with distance   for a constant channel density per volume assumption  the channel density is the same within the zone containing channels at all sampling scales larger than the representative elementary volume  rev      fig

carry a number of processed or refined petroleum products such as    processed natural gas liquids  butane and propane  gasoline  diesel  refined fuel oils  convey unrefined crude oil from producing areas to large storage areas or directly to refineries  transmission pipelines will generally require much larger pipe than gathering systems  transmission systems normally are designed for long distances and will require pressure boosting equipment along the route      onshore pipelines     many factors must be considered when designing  building  and operating a pipeline system  once the

constituent  when natural gas is produced from an underground reservoir  it is saturated with water vapor and might contain heavy hydrocarbon compounds as well as nonhydrocarbon impurities  in the raw

which would have a higher market value on extraction as compared with their heating value if left in the gas      objectives of gas treating and processing     before the optimum design of any gas

specifications for the residue gas  and rate of gas sales      consumer expectations      the end user of natural gas needs to be assured of two conditions before committing to the use of gas in a home or factory    the gas must be of consistent quality  meeting sales gas specifications  the supply of gas must be available at all times at the contracted rate  gas treating facilities  therefore  must be designed to convert a particular raw gas mixture into a sales gas that meets the sales gas specifications  and such facilities must operate without interruption      typical sales gas specifications     specifications for sales gas describe the required physical properties of the gas such that it can be transported under high pressure through long distance pipelines at ground temperature without forming liquids  which could cause corrosion  hydrates  or liquid slugs into downstream equipment  limits on the content of certain nonhydrocarbon compounds are also specified  while the specific limits for each item might vary among transmission companies or customers  the overall specifications for sales gas generally include    maximum hydrocarbon dewpoint temperature at a pressure of     psig   maximum allowable co  content   maximum allowable h s content and total organic sulfur content   maximum allowable water vapor content   maximum allowable temperature of gas leaving the plant   minimum pressure to enter the gas transmission grid   minimum heating value   free of dust  treating chemicals  and other contaminants from the process plant   in long distance

hydrocarbon liquids reduce the pipeline efficiency and might hold up in the line to form liquid slugs  which might damage downstream compression equipment  condensed water can do the same  additionally  water could form solid complexes  hydrates   which accumulate and block the line  the dewpoint temperature at any pressure is the temperature at which either hydrocarbons or water condense upon cooling of the gas  thus  the specifications for sales gas include limits on the hydrocarbon dewpoint temperature  as well as limits on the water vapor content of the gas   knowing the specifications  and knowing the required sales gas flow rate and the composition of the raw gas and condensate entering the plant  the various process vessels can be designed  and the optimum process

for characterizing heterogeneous reservoirs  it often is preferable to traditional interpolation approaches  in part because it captures the heterogeneous character observed in many petroleum reservoirs and provides more accurate hydrocarbon reserve estimates  geostatistical simulation methods preserve the variance observed in the data  instead of just the mean value  as in interpolation  their stochastic approach allows calculation of many equally probable solutions  realizations   which can be post processed to quantify and assess uncertainty      use of stochastic approach     many practitioners are suspicious of stochastic methods   and even reject them outright   because natural processes that form reservoirs are not random  but geostatistical stochastic simulation is not a coin toss experiment  furthermore  while it is true that reservoirs are not products of random processes  it also is true that they have attributes that cause them to behave as if they were random

the deterministic approach  though  it provides geoscientists and reservoir engineers with many realizations  the kriged solution is the average of numerous realizations  and the variability in the

leading edge                       what do we want from a simulation      which simulation method we choose depends on what we want from a stochastic modeling effort and   to great extent   the types of available data  not all conditional simulation studies need a    cadillac    method  for many  a    volkswagen    serves the purpose well  among the reasons for performing stochastic simulation  four important ones are    to capture heterogeneity  to simulate facies or petrophysical properties  or both  to honor and integrate multiple data types  to quantify and assess uncertainty     principles of stochastic modeling     in general  conditional simulation requires that the basic input parameters   the spatial model  variograms  and the distribution of sample values  cumulative distribution function  or cdf    remain constant within a given geologic interval and or facies  from realization to realization  typically  the structural and stratigraphic model  major structural surfaces and the discretized layers between them  remains fixed  because each realization begins with a different  random seed number  each has a unique    random walk     or navigational path through the  d volume  the random walk provides the simulation algorithm with the order of cells to be simulated  and is different from realization to realization  therefore  the results are different at unsampled locations  producing local changes in the distribution of facies and petrophysical properties in the interwell space  note that selection of the same random seed always will reproduce the same random walk  this characteristic is for computational convenience  in practice  multiple realizations are performed at or close to the geologic scale  and not necessarily at the flow simulation scale   there are two basic categories of conditional simulation methods    pixel based methods operate on one pixel at a time  they can be used with either continuous or categorical data   object based methods operate on groups of pixels that are connected and arranged to represent genetic shapes of geologic features  they are used onl

received far in the future  other than a desire for instant gratification  there is a very rational reason for this phenomenon  if we have a dollar today  we can put it to work by making an investment and have more than a dollar at some future date  this concept of putting the money to work has important implications later in this section when discount rates are discussed      concept of equivalence     another important concept is the concept of equivalence between a current lump sum of money and a lump sum to be received in the future  offering someone a choice between receiving      today and receiving      one year from today can demonstrate this  most people will opt for the      today  if we increase the amount of future money to      or      or perhaps      and guarantee payment  there will be a point at which the future sum of money will become more attractive than the current       the amount of future money necessary to sway the person to choose the future sum is dependent upon many things  which include  among others    the inflation rate  current opportunities to invest the       perceived risk  no matter what the amount of money necessary to tip the scales  the concept that money has a time value is established   in the case just discussed  if the person is indifferent to receiving      one year from now or      now  we say that the two sums are  quot equivalent  quot  this concept of equivalence is fundamental to the evaluation of all engineering projects  we are often faced with the choice of having a certain sum of money now or receiving various sums of money in the future  by determining the equivalence between money received today and money received in the future  we can make an informed decision   in the previous example  making the choice is relatively simple  there are only two sums to compare  and the time period is one year  this is usually not the case in oil gas property evaluations  so we need a mechanism to handle complex choices  the mechanism that works best is interest   we can define interest as the amount of money that must be added to our current sum to make an equivalent future sum  the amount of interest necessary to create equivalence is dependent upon the period under consideration  we may be indifferent to receiving         now          six months from now       one year from now  in that case  the        or        is the amount of interest  to easily compare all three alternatives  interest is compared as a rate  it may be expressed as       per six months or     per year  the interest rate is calculated by dividing the amount of interest paid per period by the principal amount at the beginning of the period  often  interest rate is expressed on an annual basis such as     per annum   for loans or bank deposits that exceed one year  the interest is usually compounded  that is  the interest earned during the first period is added to the original principal to form the principal for the second period  the compound interest concept will be used when calculating the equivalence between a sum of money today and future sums of money       future worth of a lump sum      if we have a present sum of money    p    and we put it to work at a compound interest rate    i    we will have a future lump sum of money    f    at the end of   n   periods  the relationship between these parameters is expressed in equation form as  rtenotitle                         the term        i     n   is called the single payment compound amount factor in many texts and is often tabulated          example    future value              is placed in a bank paying     per compounding period  how much money will be in the account after five periods     f       p         i     n       f                            f                   present worth of lump sum      present worth of lump sum is by far the most important equation in discussing the time value of money  this one equation allows the creation of an equivalence between future projected net cash flows and current sums of money  which can then be compared to the amount to be invested to obtain those net cash flows   if an amount    f    is going to be received n periods in the future  then its present value    p    can be calculated for a given interest rate    i    by rearranging    eq        rtenotitle                         this is the inverse of the single payment compound amount formula  the justification for this formula lies in the equivalence concept  the sums   p   and   f   are equivalent to each other because   p   could be invested at   i   for   n   periods to become   f    the term        i        n   is often referred to as the     quot single payment present worth factor quot    quot discount factor quot

procedural structure  they may cause unexpected behaviors that can mislead an operator into choosing the wrong procedure  the one circulation method is used to demonstrate the effect of these variables       influx type      the influx type entering the wellbore plays a key role in casing pressure behavior  the influx can range from heavy oil to fresh water  the most common is gas or salt water  each has a pronounced casing pressure curve and different downhole effects        gas kicks       gas kicks are generally more dramatic than other influx types  reasons for this include    the

cause special problems  there have been numerous recent studies of gravity segregation phenomena in an effort to quantify a migration rate  field data from one professional well killing corporation suggests a rate of   to    ft min in mud systems  regardless of the rate  the migration effect must be considered  because of the potential for gas expansion  if the fluid is not allowed to expand properly during the migration period  trapped pressure will be generated at the surface  if unnecessary expansion occurs  additional formation gas will enter the well  example   illustrates the gas

services to the platform to be severed  including the mud and pumps   the engineer on the platform knew the kick would become a problem from gas migration up the annulus  to rectify the situation  he allowed the migration to build pressure on the drillpipe  up to     psi  which he used as a    psi safety margin  thereafter  the migration was allowed to build the   p    sidp   up to     psi before he bled a small volume of mud from the annulus to reduce the drillpipe pressure down to     psi  because bottomhole pressure was still    psi more than formation pressure  no additional influx

calculations  this type of interpretation can be carried out without any advanced simulation  it is important to integrate the data obtained from the geological model  primary production data   d seismic data  if available   and tracer data in a systematic way   the second level of analysis uses basic mathematical models to fit simple response curves by means of theoretical expressions and to decompose complex responses in several simpler functions  in this way  partial residence times  as well as other parameters  can be determined for each function  mathematical models also allow for the evaluation of important parameters  such as permeability  and make it possible to predict the behavior of unknown patterns   finally  complex mathematical models like numerical finite element

tubing operations minimizes the chance for equipment failure because of fluid and sand cutting  the following procedure avoids excessive pressure differential across the valves during the unloading operation  the permissible rate of increase in the injection gas pressure downstream of the control device can be greater for an open installation without a packer than for an installation with a packer  most of the load fluid from the casing annulus will be u tubed through the lower end of the tubing in an open installation  whereas all the load fluid in the annulus must pass through the small ports of the gas lift valves in an installation with a packer  the initial u tubing is the most critical operation during the unloading procedure  there is no reason to hurry the u tubing of the load fluid to uncover the top gas lift valve  because the tubing remains full of load fluid during the u tubing operation  there is no drawdown in flowing bottomhole pressure  gas lifting does not begin until the initial u tubing is completed and injection gas enters the tubing through the top valve  the load fluid production rate is controlled by the rate of increase in the injection gas pressure  which in turn  depends on the injection gas rate  because most gas lift installations include a packer  the load fluid enters the tubing through the gas lift valves  if the load fluid contains sand and debris and full line injection gas pressure is applied to the casing by opening a large valve on the injection gas line  the gas lift valves may leak after the well is unloaded  an instantaneous pressure differential that is approximately equal to the full line injection gas pressure occurs across every gas lift valve because the casing and tubing are full of load fluid  if sand or debris is in the load fluid  the resulting high fluid velocity through the small valve ports might fluid cut the seats  the following procedure is recommended for monitoring and controlling the unloading operations for all gas lift installations to prevent damage to the gas lift valves and surface facilities    install a two pen pressure recorder that is accurate and in good working condition  the injection gas pressure downstream of the gas control device and the wellhead tubing pressure should always be recorded during the entire unloading operation   if the well has been shut

outward from the eye of the impeller where it enters the casing  differential head can be increased by turning the impeller faster  using a larger impeller  or by increasing the number of impellers  the impeller and the fluid being pumped are isolated from the outside by packing or mechanical seals  shaft radial and thrust bearings restrict the movement of the shaft and reduce the friction of rotation      basic classifications     centrifugal pumps are designed with respect to the    number of suctions  single or double   number of impellers  single  double  or multistage   output  impellers  type  number of vanes  etc    most impellers are arranged from one side only and are called single suction design  high flow models use impellers that accept suction from both sides and are called double suction design   back to top     impeller types     the efficiency of a centrifugal pump is determined by the impeller  vanes are designed to meet a given range of flow conditions     fig       illustrates the basic types of impellers    file vol  page     image      png    fig      basic types of impellers       back to top      open impellers      vanes are attached to the central hub  without any form  sidewall  or shroud  and are mounted directly onto a shaft  open impellers are structurally weak and require higher npshr values  they are typically used in small diameter  inexpensive pumps and pumps handling suspended solids  they are more sensitive to wear than closed impellers  thus their efficiency deteriorates rapidly in erosive service   back to top      partially open or semiclosed impellers      this type of impeller incorporates a back wall  shroud  that serves to stiffen the vanes and adds mechanical strength  they are used in medium diameter pumps and with liquids containing small amounts of suspended solids  they offer higher efficiencies and lower npshr than open impellers  it is important that a small clearance or gap exists between the impeller vanes and the housing  if the clearance is too large  slippage and recirculation will occur  which in turn results in reduced efficiency and positive heat buildup   back to top      closed impellers      the closed impeller has both a back and front wall for maximum strength  they are used in large pumps with high efficiencies and low npshr  they can operate in suspended solids service without clogging but will exhibit high wear rates  the closed impeller type is the most widely used type of impeller for centrifugal pumps handling clear liquids  they rely on close clearance wear rings on the impeller and on the pump housing  the wear rings separate the inlet pressure from the pressure within the pump  reduce axial loads  and help maintain pump efficiency   back to top     number of impellers         single stage pumps      the single stage centrifugal pump  consisting of one impeller  is the most widely used in production operations  they are used in pumping services of low to moderate tdhs  the tdh  total dynamic head  is a function of the impeller   s top speed  normally not higher than     ft min  single stage pumps can be either single or double suction  the single stage pump design is widely accepted and has proved to be highly reliable  however  they have higher unbalanced thrust and radial forces at off design flow rates than multistage designs and have limited tdh capabilities   back to top      multistage pumps      the multistage centrifugal pump consists of two or more impellers  they are used in pumping services of moderate to high tdhs  each stage is essentially a separate pump  all the stages are within the same housing and installed on the same shaft  eight or more stages can be installed on a single horizontal shaft  there is no limit to the number of stages that can be installed on a vertical shaft  each stage increases the head by approximately the same amount  multistage pumps can be either single or double suction on the first impeller   back to top     impeller axial loading     a single suction  enclosed or semienclosed impeller is inherently subject to continual end thrust  the thrust is directed axially toward the suction because of the low pressures that exist in the impeller eye during pump operation  this thrust is handled with a thrust bearing  the larger the tdh and the larger the impeller eye diameter  the larger the thrust  excessive thrust results in bearing and seal damage   thrust can be reduced by designing a single stage impeller for a double suction  in multistage pumps  thrust can be reduced by facing half the impellers in one direction and half in the other  balancing holes can be used in single suction  single stage pumps  the impeller is cored at the rear shroud to allow high pressure

uncertainty  it is possible to mitigate that risk by carrying out geomechanical analysis in real time  performing real time assessment requires acquisition of a variety of data while drilling      overview     annular pressure measurement using a pressure while drilling  pwd  tool is one key component of real time stability analysis because knowledge of the hydrostatic and circulating pressures is required to    determine the magnitude of kicks  identify borehole ballooning events  monitor hole cleaning  the measurement can also be used to show where transient pressure events such as surging and breaking the gel strength of the mud exceed fracture pressure  or where swabbing reduces the pressure below the pore or collapse pressure of the wellbore  information for use in constraining pore pressure and rock strength is provided by    logging while drilling  lwd  resistivity  sonic velocity  bulk density  direct pore pressure measurements while drilling can provide critical data to calibrate pore pressure predictions in permeable formations  extended leakoff tests are strongly recommended  even observations of cuttings shapes and volume can be important to identify the amount and cause of wellbore failure  because the relationship between rock strength and log data is often poorly known  penetrometer tests and velocity measurements on cuttings are useful both to quantify the strength parameters and relate them to a measurement that can be obtained while drilling  however  the single measurement that would contribute the most to wellbore stability analysis is a wellbore image log  from which breakout characteristics can be determined      fig       shows examples of displays of real time wellbore stability pressure plots  on the left is a display as a function of time  with collapse and lost circulation pressures predicted using the geomechanical model superimposed on the real time and recorded data from a pwd tool  as the well was being drilled  a mud loss episode occurred  which the analysis indicates occurred because the downhole equivalent circulating density  ecd  exceeded the fracture gradient  this indicated that the model was fairly accurate at that depth  deeper in the hole  data recorded while drilling indicated that an adjustment needed to be made to the geomechanical model     fig    b    shows a plot of predicted mud weights as a function of depth on which the real time pwd pressure data have been superimposed  in this case  the ecd is high enough to avoid drilling problems  but it appears that the static mud weight is very close to the minimum required to avoid excessive instability  based on this observation  high cuttings volumes should be expected  and one recommendation would be to take extra care to avoid high running speeds and accelerations that might swab the hole    file devol      final page     image      png    fig      this figure shows examples of time based  a  and depth based  b  displays of real

drilled          evaluating problems and drilling options     a key component of real time analysis is to provide an understanding of the origin of problems to make the right adjustment to drilling parameters to compensate  for example  when drilling through shales with inhibitive  chemically nonreactive  mud  fluid leakage may change the mud characteristics over time  when would an adjustment to the mud properties be required  a comparison of stability risk vs  mud chemistry could help make that decision  or what happens if the rock strength suddenly decreases due to crossing from relatively strong shale into one that is much weaker  to handle this case  a crossplot of breakout width as a function of   c    o   and mud weight can be used to determine the amount of mud weight adjustment required      figs       and         show a hypothetical case of using geomechanical decision tools to help evaluate various drilling options when crossing from a strong shale into one that is substantially weaker and highly reactive  in    fig        it is apparent for this hypothetical case that to maintain the same degree of stability if   c    o   decreases from       psi to       psi  it is necessary to increase the mud weight to a value that exceeds the fracture gradient  this makes it impossible to continue drilling  and the options are either to stop and set casing or to investigate other possibilities    file devol      final page     image      png    fig      prediction of breakout width in reactive shale drilled using a non reactive drilling mud as a function of

seismic attributes  amplitude  phase  frequency  can be used in interpretation  in practice  most interpreters use instantaneous amplitude  or some variation of an amplitude attribute  as their primary diagnostic tool  amplitude is related to reflectivity  which in turn is related to subsurface impedance contrasts  thus  amplitude attributes provide information about all the rock  fluid  and formation pressure conditions listed in    table       geological influences on acoustic impedance   instantaneous phase is useful for tracking reflection continuity and stratal surfaces across low amplitude areas where it is difficult to see details of reflection waveform character  in general  instantaneous phase is the least used of the seismic attributes   instantaneous frequency sometimes aids in recognizing changes in bed thickness and bed spacing  anomalous values of instantaneous frequency  negative values or unbelievably high positive values  are particularly useful for recognizing

chronostratigraphic defines this type of seismic reflection event  because lithology varies across the area spanned by a large depositional surface  the implication of this interpretation principle is that an areally pervasive seismic reflection event does not necessarily mark an impedance contrast boundary between two fixed rock types as that reflection traverses an area of interest  the application of this fundamental concept about the genetic origin of seismic reflections to seismic interpretation is referred to as stratal surface seismic interpretation   tippertipper  j c        do seismic reflections necessarily have chronostratigraphic significance  geology                  illustrated and discussed situations in which a seismic reflection can be either chronostratigraphic or diachronous  meaning that the event moves across depositional time surfaces   depending on the vertical spacings between beds  the lateral discontinuity between diachronous beds  and bed thickness  the conclusion that a seismic reflection is chronostratigraphic or diachronous needs to be made with caution because the answer depends on the local stratigraphy  the seismic bandwidth  and the horizontal and vertical resolution of the seismic data   if two seismic reflection events  a and b  are separated by an appreciable seismic time interval  a few hundred milliseconds  yet are conformable to each other  that is  they parallel each other   then the uniform seismic time thickness between these two events represents a constant and fixed period of geologic time throughout the seismic image space spanned by reflectors a and b  an implication of seismic stratigraphy that can be invoked in such an instance is that any seismic surface intermediate to a and b  which is also conformable to a and b  is also a stratal surface   back to top     types of stratal interfaces     a key first step in seismic interpretation is to use well logs and cores to identify the three types

 overview     an important consideration related to intermittent gas lift operations is the injection gas breakthrough and resulting loss of the liquid production per cycle from the injection gas penetrating the liquid slug during the time required to displace this slug to the surface  the produced liquid slug can be a small fraction of the starting slug size because of injection gas breakthrough  the losses are greater when the injection gas pressure is low and the required depth of lift is near total depth in a deep well   for example  a        ft well with a bottomhole flowing pressure of     psig and an available injection gas pressure of only     psig can be gas lifted intermittently with the proper plunger  the well could not be gas lifted successfully from this depth without a plunger      intermittent gas lift plunger application     a typical plunger installation for intermittent gas lift operation is shown in    fig        a plunger can be expected to decrease the injection gas requirement for an intermittent gas lift installation from    to     depending on plunger construction  the depth of lift  injection gas pressure  and adjustment of the injection gas volume to the well before the plunger is installed    file vol  page     image      png    fig    plunger in an intermittent gas lift installation       there is little if any liquid slug recovery by intermittent gas lift from very deep wells with low injection gas pressure unless a plunger is installed  the plunger provides a solid interface between the starting liquid slug and the displacing injection gas  the plunger practically eliminates liquid fallback as a result of gas penetrating the liquid slug  the increase in liquid recovery and the decrease in the injection gas requirement per cycle from installing a plunger are minimal in an intermittent gas lift installation with small liquid slugs being lifted at an exceedingly high slug velocity in shallow wells  another advantage of a plunger is that it reduces paraffin in a well with a paraffin problem  plungers are installed in some wells for the sole purpose of keeping the tubing free of paraffin deposition   a plunger can be installed in an existing tubing retrievable conventional gas lift valve installation by wireline without pulling the tubing if there are no tight spots in the tubing  a standing valve and a bottomhole collar lock or a stop with a bumper spring can be installed with wireline tools  a standing valve normally is recommended but not required in wells with a low permeability  the bottomhole bumper spring is located immediately above the operating gas lift valve  and a standing valve is stationed below the valve  the remaining equipment is on the surface and includes a lubricator with a bumper spring and a plunger catcher mechanism  a plunger arrival detector to shut in the tubing is not needed for an intermittent gas lift installation because the tubing is not shut in between injection gas cycles   a plunger ascent velocity of     to       ft min is recommended for the most efficient lift  a plunger may stall or tend to stop and start at plunger velocities less than     to     ft min  plunger velocities in excess of       to       ft min are not recommended because of possible damage to the plunger on arrival at the surface and an apparent tendency to bypass a thicker than normal liquid boundary on the tubing wall  noting the times when a time cycle controller opens and when the plunger arrives at the surface can approximate an average plunger velocity       conditions that favor the use of plunger in an intermittent gas lift      the addition of a plunger to an intermittent gas lift installation should be considered when    the available injection gas pressure is low relative to the required depth of lift in a low flowing bottomhole pressure well  there is an excessive increase in wellhead tubing pressure as the liquid slug enters the flowline because of such factors as a small inside diameter  id  flowline  excessive number of bends at the wellhead  and flowline choke  a paraffin deposition problem exists  a plunger should increase the efficiency required of most intermittent gas lift installations  because a plunger adds several moving parts  it can also increase the operating problems       conditions that prohibit the use of plunger in an intermittent gas lift      well conditions that prohibit the use of a plunger are    a bore opening through surface wellhead and tree valves that differs from the tubing id  excessive well deviation  which prevents a plunger from descending to its bottomhole bumper spring  tight spots in the tubing  appreciable sand production  high rate intermittent gas lift operations  the fall time required for a plunger to descend to the bottom bumper spring could reduce the maximum production from a high cycle frequency intermi

nature of the conformance problem to be treated  this includes  during water  or gas shutoff treatments  identifying the flow path of excessive water or gas production from its source to the production wellbore      gel technology selection   the following procedure for gel technology selection is highly generalized  and the procedure should be modified as dictated by the actual reservoir conformance problem to be treated  if a service company or a company specializing in conformance treatment gels is to be involved  they should be consulted during each step of the selection process  a prerequisite is to eliminate all gel technologies  if any  that are prohibited by locally applicable safety or environmental regulations    first  determine the type of problem that is to be treated  that is  whether it is a matrix rock problem or a high permeability anomaly problem  such as fractures  if treating a matrix rock problem  decide if you need a gel for treating near wellbore or deeply in the reservoir  determine how strong the gel needs to be  if the gel must be placed deep in the reservoir  economic constraints on the unit volume cost of gel pumped need to be carefully factored into the gel technology selection process  if the gel treatment will require a shut in time following gel placement  decide on the shut in strategy  i e   what shut in time range is acceptable  and chose a gel technology accordingly  then  begin to select a gel technology that will function as required at the reservoir temperature being treated    next  if treating a high permeability anomaly   gt    darcy  conformance problem  select a gel treatment fluid that can be injected into the reservoir in a mature or partially mature state  if treating matrix rock conformance problems for which all the permeabilities are less than approximately   darcy  select a gel technology that can be injected in the gelant state  after completing these steps in the gel selection process  decide what the initial and near full gelation times should be  depending on the exact needs of the treatment design so far  predict the thermal history that the gelant will experience as it is being injected  if a precise thermal history for the gelant as it is being injected is required  computer thermal simulation work may be needed    based on the outcome of the gel technology selection process so far  numerous conformance gel technologies may have already been ruled out  if so  the remaining selection process may be simpler  next  the remaining gel technologies  which fit all the gel technology selection criteria  should be sorted through to select the gel technology that will perform the most effectively in treating the reservoir conformance problem and will meet the specialized needs of the operator who is applying the gel treatment  at this point  if economically justified  comparative laboratory studies may be conducted to help select with more certainty which of several gel technologies will perform most effectively in treating the reservoir conformance problem that is to be remedied      treatment sizing   technical sophistication relating to the method used to size the volumes of various conformance improvement gel treatments needs improvement  the encouraging news is that there are active r amp d programs that are specifically pursuing the development of a more rigorous scientific and engineering basis for use in the sizing of conformance improvement gel treatments  seright  liang  and sedall reports on a sound engineering basis for the sizing of polymer gel treatments  injected as gelants  for treating excessive water production that results when a hydraulic fracture inadvertently extends down into an aquifer or into some other type of water bearing geological strata  seright  liang  and sedall also references a user friendly computer program for use in sizing such gelant treatments and provides information on how the computer program can be downloaded    unfortunately  sizing of gel treatments remains highly empirical and is often based on the experience of operators and gel service companies  there are a number of empirical guidelines for sizing conformance gel treatments  when conducting near wellbore gel treatments in matrix rock reservoirs for total shutoff purposes  such as when using a cc ap gel treatment for zone abandonment or squeeze and recompletion treatment purposes  the rule of thumb is to inject a gel treatment volume that extends  on the average    to   ft radially from the wellbore  this is a good guideline when treating reservoirs with elevated temperatures   gt       f  and large drawdown pressures   gt      psi   for lower temperatures and lower drawdown pressures  this rule of thumb can be relaxed somewhat  the depth of gel placement must be increased for gel technologies that produce relatively weaker gel strengths  for an

description of the different classifications and types of compressors available to the industry  adiabatic and polytropic compression theory are discussed with supporting definition of terminology      compression theory     specific topics relating to compression theory include    power requirement  isentropic exponent  compressibility factor  intercooling  adiabatic and polytropic efficiency  actual and standard volume flow rates  mass flow rates  inlet and discharge pressures  inlet and discharge temperatures  adiabatic and polytropic head  major components and construction features of centrifugal and reciprocating compressors are emphasized  installation  safety  and maintenance considerations also are discussed in their erspective pages      oil and gas compressor uses     compressors used in the oil and gas industry are divided into six groups according to their intended service  these are    flash gas compressors  gas lift compressors  reinjection compressors  booster compressors  vapor recovery compressors  casinghead compressors      flash gas compressors      flash gas compressors are used in oil handling facilities to compress gas that is    flashed    from a hydrocarbon liquid when the liquid flows from a higher pressure to a lower pressure separator  flash gas compressors typically handle low flow rates and produce high compression ratios       gas lift compressors      gas lift compressors are frequently used in oil handling facilities where compression of formation gases and gas lift gas is required  gas lift compressor duty is frequently of low to medium throughput with high compression ratios  many gas lift compressors are installed on offshore facilities       reinjection compressors      the reinjection of natural gas is employed to increase or to maintain oil production  reinjection compressors can be required to deliver gas at discharge pressures in excess of        psi  reinjection compressors also are used for underground storage of natural gas  compressors  applied to these services  have large compression ratios  high power requirements  and low volume flow rates       booster compressors      gas transmission through pipelines results in pressure drop because of friction losses  booster compressors are used to restore the pressure drop from these losses  selection of these compressors involves evaluating the economic trade off of distance between pipeline boosting stations and life cycle cost of each compressor station  booster compressors also are used in fields that are experiencing pressure decline  most centrifugal pipeline booster compressors are gas turbine driven  although the use of variable speed motor drives is becoming more prevalent  low speed integral gas engine reciprocating compressors also are used for gas transmission applications  booster compressors typically are designed for high throughput rates and low compression ratio  many booster applications can be configured in a single stage centrifugal compressor       vapor recovery compressors      vapor recovery compressors are used to gather gas from tanks and other low pressure equipment in the facility  often the gas from a vapor recovery compressor is routed to a flash gas  gas lift  or booster compressor for further compression  low suction pressures  high compression ratios  and low gas throughput rates characterize these compressors       casinghead compressors      casinghead compressors are usually used with electric submersible pumps and rod pumps where formation gas is required to be separated downhole and then transported through the annulus  often the compressor discharge is routed to either a booster or flash gas compressor or to a low pressure gathering system  like vapor recovery compressors  casinghead compressors operate with low suction pressures  high compression ratios  and low gas throughput rates      classification and types     compressors are classified into two major categories       positive displacement compressors      positive displacement compressors are further divided into    reciprocating  rotary types      dynamic or kinetic compressors      dynamic compressors are continuous flow machines in which a rapidly rotating element accelerates the gas as it passes through the element  converting the velocity head into pressure  partially in the rotating element and partially in stationary diffusers or blades  dynamic compressors are further divided into    centrifugal  axial flow  mixed flow types     compression theory     both positive displacement and dynamic compressors are governed by a few basic principles derived from the laws of thermodynamics  this section defines terminology and discusses the operating principles essential for understanding

well  even in very carefully planned wells  for example  in areas in which similar drilling practices are used  hole problems may have been reported where no such problems existed previously because formations are nonhomogeneous  therefore  two wells near each other may have totally different geological conditions in well planning  the key to achieving objectives successfully is to design drilling programs on the basis of anticipation of potential hole problems rather than on caution and containment  drilling problems can be very costly  the most prevalent drilling problems include pipe sticking  lost circulation  hole deviation  pipe failures  borehole instability  mud contamination  formation damage  hole cleaning  h s bearing formation and shallow gas  and equipment and personnel related problems understanding and anticipating drilling problems  understanding their causes  and planning solutions are necessary for overall well cost control and for successfully reaching the target zone  this chapter addresses these problems  possible solutions  and  in some cases  preventive measures  __toc__     pipe sticking     during drilling operations  a pipe is considered stuck if it cannot be freed and pulled out of the hole without damaging the pipe and without exceeding the drilling rig     s maximum allowed hook load  differential pressure pipe sticking and mechanical pipe sticking are addressed in this section      differential pressure pipe sticking      differential pressure pipe sticking occurs when a portion of the drillstring becomes embedded in a mudcake  an impermeable film of fine solids  that forms on the wall of a permeable formation during drilling  if the mud pressure    p    m     which acts on the outside wall of the pipe  is greater than the formation fluid pressure    p    ff     which generally is the case  with the exception of underbalanced drilling   then the pipe is said to be differentially stuck  see    fig            the differential pressure acting on the portion of the drillpipe that is embedded in the mudcake can be expressed as file devol      final page     image      png    fig         differential

controllable parameters that will cause higher pipe sticking force and the potential inability of freeing the stuck pipe  these parameters are unnecessarily high differential pressure  thick mudcake  high continuous fluid loss to formation   low lubricity mudcake  high coefficient of friction   and excessive embedded pipe length in mudcake  delay of time in freeing operations  although hole and pipe diameters and hole angle play a role in the pipe sticking force  they are uncontrollable variables once they are selected to meet well design objectives  however  the shape of drill collars  such as square  or the use of drill collars with spiral grooves and external upset tool joints can minimize the sticking force some of the indicators of differential pressure stuck pipe while drilling permeable zones or known depleted pressure zones are an increase in torque and drag  an inability to reciprocate the drillstring and  in some cases  to rotate it  and uninterrupted drilling fluid circulation  differential pressure pipe sticking can be prevented or its occurrence mitigated if some or all of the following precautions are taken    maintain the lowest continuous fluid loss adhering to the project economic objectives   maintain the lowest level of drilled solids in the mud system  or  if economical  remove all drilled solids   use the lowest differential pressure with allowance for swab and surge pressures during tripping operations   select a mud system that will yield smooth mudcake  low coefficient of friction    maintain drillstring rotation at all times  if

applications      how pnl logs work     pnl logs measure the die away time of a short lived neutron pulse  they probe the formation with neutrons but detect gamma rays  chlorine has a particularly large capture cross section for thermal neutrons  if the chlorine in the formation brine dominates the total neutron capture losses  a neutron lifetime log will track chlorine concentration and  thus  the bulk volume of water in the formation  for constant porosity  the log will track water saturation    s    w    the neutrons are little affected by steel casing  so this is the standard cased hole saturation tool  like other nuclear tools  modern pnl tools incorporate two detectors for borehole compensation  these detectors also permit the calculation of a ratio porosity  this ratio porosity is similar  but not identical  to that of a compensated neutron porosity tool  they differ because the energy of the neutrons from the pulsed accelerator source is higher than the energy from the isotopic source used in compensated neutron logging  also  the neutron lifetime tools detect capture gamma rays rather than direct neutrons   the basis of operation is similar to the other nuclear radiation transport tools in that the tool infers a cross section  in this case  the tool measures the time required for a pulse of neutrons to be absorbed by a formation  the mechanism by which the neutrons disappear is primarily thermal neutron capture  the time evolution of a pulse of neutrons follows the usual exponential decay law   rtenotitle                         where   abs is the total

formation follows the standard linear volumetric mixing law discussed above   rtenotitle                         where   v    i   is the volume of a particular constituent  mineral or fluid  of a formation and     i   is the capture cross section of that constituent  because the corrected tool reads the total capture cross of the formation  this equation forms the basis of interpretation  for

measurement to be very sensitive to replacing oil by water in the pore space  the water salinity needs to be higher than        ppm nacl  otherwise  the oil and water capture cross sections are so similar that the measured formation cross section will not change perceptibly when one is substituted for the other  these sensitivities can be evaluated easily by setting up a simple spreadsheet and varying the values in the equation above     eq      also suggests the value of running this log in a baseline monitor mode or time lapse mode  differences between successive logging runs will depend only on differences in fluid volumes because the terms involving the unchanging rock matrix will subtract out  in this way  no explicit knowledge of the capture cross sections of the minerals and clays is required to interpret saturation changes   rtenotitle                         while it is rarely done  this method is particularly valuable if a baseline run is made early in the production

neutron log is run over a zone of interest to get a baseline reading  then  a brine of contrasting salinity is injected into the formation while logging pass after pass with the pulsed neutron tool

flood  it is crucial to identify the phase behavior occurring in the reservoir  phase diagrams are a typical method for representing phase behavior      ternary and pseudoternary phase diagrams     ternary diagrams and pseudoternary diagrams have been used for decades to visualize conceptually the phase behavior of injection fluid crude oil systems  this is done by representing multicomponent fluids or mixtures by three pseudocomponents and then plotting fluid compositions in the interior of an equilateral triangle with apexes that represent      of each pseudocomponent and where the side opposite an apex represents    of that pseudocomponent  usually  the three pseudocomponents represent    a fraction of low molecular weight materials  a fraction of intermediate molecular weight materials  a fraction of the higher molecular weight materials  for example  the low molecular weight fraction might include methane and nitrogen and perhaps co  if co  is the primary injection solvent  the intermediate molecular weight pseudocomponent might include the c     c  hydrocarbons and perhaps co  if the co  is a constituent of an otherwise hydrocarbon injection solvent  the higher molecular weight pseudocomponent in this scheme would be the leftover c   fraction  there is no particularly  quot right quot  way to divide a fluid into three pseudocomponents  different injection processes may be better represented by one type of grouping vs  another  and different groupings may give somewhat different insights into phase behavior mechanisms   pseudoternary diagrams apply rigorously only to true ternary systems  and a strictly ternary analogy may give a somewhat misleading view of the mass transfer mechanisms that result in compositional enhancement  even so  a pseudoternary diagram is still a useful way to represent some complex phase behavior concepts that are not so easily visualized otherwise   a ternary diagram represents phase behavior at a constant temperature and pressure     fig   martin  w e        the wizard lake d  a pool miscible flood  presented at the international petroleum exhibition and technical symposium  beijing  china        march

vaporizing gas drive process  after young and martin        the diagram in    fig       has the following characteristics    there is a bubblepoint curve representing oil mixtures at their bubblepoint and a dewpoint curve representing solvent mixtures at their dewpoint  these curves come together at a critical composition   the dashed lines  called tie lines  connect liquid and solvent compositions that are in equilibrium   all mixtures inside the region bounded by the bubblepoint and dewpoint curves consist of two phases   the tie line that passes through a given mixture composition gives the equilibrium solvent and liquid compositions for this mixture where it intersects the dewpoint and bubblepoint curves   the tie line that just passes through the critical composition is called the critical tie line   all mixtures outside the region bounded by the dewpoint and bubblepoint curves are single phase      vaporizing solvent drive process        fig       shows how compositions change in situ when a lean injection solvent displaces an oil represented by point a  whose composition lies just to the right of the limiting tie line   the injection solvent identified on the c    c      side of the triangle has a high methane content  when this solvent mixes with the reservoir fluid  an overall composition such as m  may result  m  is in the two phase region of the diagram and consists of dewpoint solvent g  and bubblepoint liquid l    as more solvent is injected  solvent g   formed in the first contact  is pushed ahead  where it contacts fresh reservoir fluid  upon mixing  solvent g  and the reservoir fluid form another overall mixture  m   which consists of dewpoint solvent g  and bubblepoint liquid l    solvent g  then flows ahead and contacts fresh reservoir fluid  forming an overall mixture m   which consists of dewpoint solvent g  and bubblepoint liquid l    in this way  solvent at the displacing front is progressively enriched to the critical composition p  which is first contact miscible with the reservoir fluid   in the vaporizing solvent drive process  compositional enhancement occurs by the injection solvent vaporizing intermediate molecular weight hydrocarbons from the oil and enriching the composition at the solvent front  for pseudoternary phase behavior  as long as the reservoir fluid composition lies to the right of the limiting tie line through the critical point  multiple contact miscibility can be achieved  if oil composition should lie to the left of the critical

therefore  phase composition data can no longer be represented with two  three or four coordinates  instead  phase diagrams that give more limited information are used      diagramming multicomponent

at the bubblepoint pressure     fig        when the pressure is reduced from a high level  at temperatures above the critical temperature  dewpoints are observed     fig         in this multicomponent system  the critical temperature is no longer the maximum temperature at which two phases can exist  the critical point is the temperature and pressure at which the phase compositions and all phase properties are identical   the bubblepoint  dewpoint  and single phase regions shown in    fig       are sometimes used to classify reservoirs  at temperatures greater than the cricondentherm  which is the maximum temperature for the formation of two phases  only one phase occurs at any pressure  for instance  if the hydrocarbon mixture in    fig       were to occur in a reservoir at temperature   t    a   and pressure   p    a    point a   a decline in pressure at approximately constant temperature caused by removal of fluid from the reservoir would not cause the formation of a second phase   while the fluid in the reservoir remains a single phase  the produced gas splits into two phases as it cools and expands to surface temperature and pressure at point a     thus  some condensate would be collected at the surface even though only one phase is present in the formation  the amount of condensate collected depends on the operating conditions of the separator  the lower the temperature at a given pressure  the larger the volume of condensate collected     fig             dewpoint reservoirs     dewpoint reservoirs are those for which the reservoir temperature lies between the critical temperature and the cricondentherm for the reservoir fluid  production of fluid from a reservoir starting at point b in    fig       causes liquid to appear in the reservoir when the dewpoint pressure is reached  as the pressure declines further  the saturation of liquid increases because of retrograde condensation  because the saturation of liquid is low  only the vapor phase flows to producing wells  thus  the overall composition of the fluid remaining in the reservoir changes continuously   the phase diagram shown in    fig       is for the original composition only  the preferential removal of light hydrocarbon components in the vapor phase generates new hydrocarbon mixtures  which have a greater fraction of the heavier hydrocarbons  differential liberation experiments  in which a sample of the reservoir fluid initially at high pressure is expanded through a sequence of pressures  can be used to investigate the magnitude of the effect of pressure reduction on the vapor composition  at each pressure  a portion of the vapor is removed and analyzed  these experiments simulate what happens when condensate is left behind in the reservoir as the pressure declines  see pedersen  fredenslund  and thomassenpedersen  k s   fredenslund  a a   and thomassen  p        properties of oils and natural gases  contributions in petroleum geology and

reservoir may contain faults  at which the strata are displaced  it is usually possible to identify many more layers in the geological model than it is practical to include in reservoir flow

of various materials  including carbon steel  stainless steel  and monel  it is usually more economical to use corrosion resistant polished rod liners on carbon steel polished rods than to use corrosion resistant polished rods  polished rods must be properly aligned in relation to the pumping tee  poor alignment will result in decreased life of the stuffing box packing and possible failure of the polished rod  furthermore  if the polished rod does not travel straight up and down during the pumping cycle  liners may not be practical  for situations in which the pumping unit is not properly set and or the wellhead is crooked  a full length sucker rod should be installed between the polished rod and the top of the string s pony rods  this will decrease crooked wellhead induced polished rod failures and increase packing life  the polished rod must have a coupling and a sub on top  this is required in case the rod slips because the polished rod clamp is not sufficiently tight  the coupling keeps it from falling through the stuffing box  the subrod helps retrieve the polished rod and helps prevent moisture from getting into the coupling   section    of api   spec    b  api

operated by pan american petroleum corp  in the hugoton field _ kelpper well no     located in grant county  kansas  was a low productivity well  even though it had been acidized  the well was chosen for the first hydraulic fracture stimulation treatment so that hydraulic fracturing could be compared directly with acidizing  since that first treatment in       hydraulic fracturing has become a common treatment for stimulating the productivity of oil and gas wells hydraulic fracturing is the process of pumping a fluid into a wellbore at an injection rate that is too great for the formation to accept in a radial flow pattern  as the resistance to flow in the formation increases  the pressure in the wellbore increases to a value that exceeds the breakdown pressure of the formation open to the wellbore  once the formation  quot breaks down  quot  a fracture is formed  and the injected fluid begins moving down the fracture  in most formations  a single  vertical fracture is created that propagates in two directions from the wellbore  these fracture  quot wings quot  are       apart and normally are assumed to be identical in shape and size at any point in time  however  in actual cases  the fracture wing dimensions may not be identical  in naturally fractured or cleated formations  it is possible that multiple fractures can be created and propagated during a hydraulic fracture treatment fluid that does not contain any propping agent  called the  quot pad quot   is injected to create a fracture that grows up  out  and down  and creates a fracture that is wide enough to accept a propping agent  the purpose of the propping agent is to prop open the fracture once the pumping operation ceases  the pressure in the fracture decreases  and the fracture closes  in deep reservoirs  man made ceramic beads are used to hold open or  quot prop quot  the fracture  in shallow reservoirs  sand is normally used as the propping agent this chapter discusses the processes used to design and pump a hydraulic fracture treatment and provides an overview of the theories  design methods  and materials used in a hydraulic fracture treatment   __toc__     introduction         objectives of hydraulic fracturing      in general  hydraulic fracture treatments are used to increase the productivity index of a producing well or the injectivity index of an injection well  the productivity index defines the rate at which oil or gas can be produced at a given pressure differential between the reservoir and the wellbore  the injectivity index refers to the rate at which fluid can be injected into a well at a given pressure differential there are many applications for hydraulic fracturing  hydraulic fracturing can increase the flow rate of oil and or gas from low permeability reservoirs  increase the flow rate of oil and or gas from wells that have been damaged  connect the natural fractures and or cleats in a formation to the wellbore  decrease the pressure drop around the well to minimize sand production  enhance gravel packing sand placement  decrease the pressure drop around the well to minimize problems with asphaltine and or paraffin deposition  increase the area of drainage or the amount of formation in contact with the wellbore  and connect the full vertical extent of a reservoir to a slanted or horizontal well  there could be other uses  but most of the treatments are pumped for these reasons a low permeability reservoir is one that has a high resistance to fluid flow  in many formations  chemical and or physical processes alter the reservoir rock over geologic time  sometimes  these diagenetic processes restrict the openings in the rock and reduce the ability of fluids to flow through the rock  low permeability rocks are normally excellent candidates for stimulation by hydraulic fracturing regardless of the permeability  a reservoir rock can be damaged when a well is drilled through the reservoir and when casing is set and cemented in place  damage occurs because drilling and or completion fluids leak into the reservoir and alter the pores and pore throats  when the pores are plugged  the permeability is reduced  and the fluid flow in this damaged portion of the reservoir may be substantially reduced  damage can be especially severe in naturally fractured reservoirs  to stimulate damaged reservoirs  a short  conductive hydraulic fracture is often the desired solution in many cases  especially for low permeability formations  damaged reservoirs  or horizontal wells in a layered reservoir  the well would be uneconomical unless a successful hydraulic fracture treatment is designed and pumped  the engineer in charge of the economic success of such a well must design the optimal fracture treatment and then go to the field to be certain the optimal treatment is pumped successfully       candidate selection      the success or fai

real time information to the surface for monitoring conditions during drilling operations      pressure while drilling  pwd  sensors     pressure while drilling  pwd  sensors have proved invaluable in every ubd operation to date  when they have been included in the drillstring and operated without downtime  however  quite a number of these sensors have proved problematic  because of the vibration

optimize the drilling process  and increase the operator   s knowledge of the reservoir      conventional measurement while drilling  mwd  tools in ubd     the most common technique for transmitting measurement while drilling  mwd  data uses the drilling fluid pumped down through the drillstring as a transmission medium for acoustic waves  mud pulse telemetry transmits data to the surface by modifying the flow of mud in the drillpipe in such a way that there are changes in fluid pressure at surface  it involves the sequential operation of a downhole mechanism to selectively vary or modulate the dynamic flowing pressure in the drillstring  and sends the real time data gathered by the downhole sensors  this variation in the dynamic pressure is detected at the surface  where it is demodulated back into the real measurements and parameters from the downhole sensors   signal strength at the surface depends on many factors including  but not limited to    the mud properties  drillstring arrangement  flow rate  signal strength generated at the tool  telemetry frequency  experience to date indicates that this enhanced mud pulse telemetry system is best applied to scenarios with a maximum gas percentage of      by volume at the standpipe   and this ratio can be extended somewhat depending on a number of factors  including    well depth  profile  liquid phase fluid  drillstring bottomhole assembly  bha   pumping pressure  flow rates   further reductions in borehole pressure are possible with gas lift applications in which n  is injected into the annulus  a major disadvantage of the mud pulse is that it will not work if high quality foam is needed  for such fluids  an electromagnetic method must be used   if annular gas injection is used  we have a single phase fluid down the drillstring  and conventional mwd systems can be used  if drillstring gas injection is considered  the option of using electromagnetic mwd tools must be considered      electromagnetic measurement while drilling  emwd      electromagnetic telemetry transmits data to the surface by pulsing low frequency waves through the earth  the first application of pwd measurements has been primarily for drilling and mud performance  kick detection  and equivalent circulating density  ecd  monitoring      nonreturn valves     float valves are necessary for ubd to prevent influx of reservoir fluids inside the drillstring either when tripping or making connections  it must be recognized that there is pressure below nonreturn valves  the positions of the float valve in the drillstring depend on the tools in the bottomhole assembly  bha  and the policy of the operating philosophy underpinning the safety management of the operation  the number of float valves in the bha and the drillstring is also a matter of company policy consistent with perceived risks and management thereof  if the drilling float valve s  should all fail  the well may have to be circulated to kill weight fluid  and a string trip undertaken to replace or repair the float valves   it is good practice to install a float valve in the top of the drillstring  often referred to as the string float valve  because it aids operational efficiency by reducing the time it takes to bleed off the pressure before making connections while also serving as an additional barrier in the event of a failure of the float valves in the bha  this top valve is often a wireline retrievable float valve that can be retrieved  as access through the string is required  in general  a double float valve is installed just above the bha  and a further double float valve is installed above the bit so that there is redundant service  two types of non ported drillstring floats that are commonly used are the flapper and plunger floats      deployment valves     the underbalanced deployment valve has been designed to eliminate the need for snubbing operations or the need to kill the well to trip the drillstring during ubd operations  during ubd operations  the well is allowed to flow  the result is a flowing or shut in pressure in the annulus at surface  with any significant pressures while tripping the drillstring  it has been necessary to either use a snubbing unit or kill the well   the deployment valve is run as an integral par

and ion content in the injection water control two types of formation damage in an injection well    freshwater sensitivity of the formation  precipitation of inorganic scale      fines migration      in water sensitive formations  if fresh water is being injected from a nearby lake or river  caution must be exercised to ensure that fines migration is not a major factor  this can be achieved by ensuring that the salinity is above the critical salt concentration for the rock  injection wells are usually less susceptible to fines migration problems than production wells  because the fines being generated are pushed away from the wellbore  leading to less severe impairment in the near wellbore region and therefore relatively small losses in injectivity  in some instances in which the reservoir contains large proportions of clays and fines  severe injectivity losses may be experienced when injecting below the critical salt concentration       scales and precipitates      the precipitation of inorganic scale is a major concern when injecting brines with a high concentration of divalent ions  the hardness of the injection water is a good indicator of its scaling tendency  should the water analysis indicate large concentrations of calcium  magnesium  iron  or barium  a water treatment facility that softens the water may be required  this is also an issue when injecting seawater into formations that contain brines with high salinity   large persistent drops in injectivity are expected when inorganic scales are formed in injection wells  most field experience  however  indicates that the injection fluid quickly displaces the native brines away from the near wellbore region with very little mixing  inorganic scale precipitation resulting from incompatibility between the injection and reservoir brine is therefore not usually an issue for most injection wells  geochemical interactions between injected fluids and the reservoir minerals can sometimes result in the formation of insoluble precipitates  scale precipitation can also be induced by changes in    ph  temperature  state of oxidation of the brine  the formation of insoluble iron precipitates as a result of corrosion is a common source of damage in injection wells  these precipitates  mixed with other organic material  can

bit design and performance     four considerations primarily influence bit design and performance    mechanical design parameters   materials   hydraulic conditions   properties of the rock being drilled      geometric parameters of pdc bit design     geometric considerations include bit shape or profile  which is predicated based on    cutter geometry   cutter placements   cutter density   hydraulic requirements   the abrasiveness and strength of the formations to be drilled and well geometry   each of these factors must be considered on an application to application basis to ensure achievement of rate of penetration  rop  goals during cooling  cleaning the bit  and removing cuttings efficiently  during design  all factors are considered simultaneously      cutting structure characteristics     cutting structures must provide adequate bottomhole coverage to address formation hardness  abrasiveness  and potential vibrations and to satisfy productive needs   early      s  pdc bits incorporated elementary designs without waterways or carefully engineered provisions for cleaning and cooling  by the late     s  pdc technology advanced rapidly as the result of new understanding of bit vibrations and their influence on productivity  today  cutting structures are recognized as the principal determinant of force balancing for bits and for rop during drilling       cutting mechanics      the method in which rock fails is important in bit design and selection  formation failure occurs in two modes    brittle failure   plastic failure   the mode in which a formation fails depends on rock strength  which is a function of composition and such downhole conditions as    depth  pressure  temperature  formation failure can be depicted with stress strain curves     fig         stress  applied force per unit area  can be    tensile  compressive  torsional  shear  strain is the deformation caused by the applied force  under brittle failure  the formation fails with very little or no deformation  for plastic failure  the formation deforms elastically until it yields  followed by plastic deformation until rupture    file devol      final page     image      png    fig      formation failure from stress and strain       pdc bits drill primarily by shearing  vertical penetrating force from applied drill collar weight and horizontal force from the rotary table are transmitted into the cutters     fig         the resultant force defines a plane of thrust for the cutter  cuttings are then sheared off at an initial angle relative to the plane of thrust  which is dependent on rock strength    file devol      final page     image      png    fig      shear and thrust on a cutter       formations that are drillable with pdc bits fail in shear rather than compressive stress typified by the crushing and gouging action of roller cone bits  thus  pdc bits are designed primarily to drill by shearing  in shear  the energy required to reach plastic limit for rupture is significantly less than by compressive stress  pdc bits require less weight on bit  wob  than roller cone bits   thermally stable pdc cutters are designed to plow or grind harder formations  because of their thermal stability and wear resistance  this grinding action breaks cementing materials bonding individual grains of rock      cutters     cutters are expected to endure throughout the life of a bit  to perform well  they must receive both structural support and efficient orientation from bit body features  their orientation must be such that they are loaded only by compressive forces during operation  to prevent loss  cutters must be retained by braze material that has adequate structural capabilities and has been properly deposited during manufacturing   cutters are strategically placed on a bit face to ensure complete bottomhole coverage     cutter density    refers to the number of cutters used in a particular bit design  pdc bit cutter density is a function of profile shape and length and of cutter size  type  and quantity  if there is a redundancy of cutters  it generally increases from the center of the bit to the outer radii because of increasing requirements for work as radial distance from the bit centerline increases  cutters nearer to the gauge must travel farther and faster and remove more rock than cutters near the centerline  regional cutter density can be examined by rotating each cutter   s placement onto a single radial plane     fig           file devol      final page     image      png    fig      planar representation of cutter density increase with radial position       reducing the number of cutters on a bit faces yields the following results    the depth of cut increases   rop increases   torque increases   bit life is shortened   increasing cutter density yields    decrease in rop   decrease in cutting structure cleaning efficiency

indicators are capable of measuring a limited amount of negative weight   typically equal to the weight of the chaindrive assembly mounted in the injector frame  if this type of weight indicator is being used  the thrust force applied during the ct operation should not exceed the weight of the chaindrive assembly        tubing guide arch       the counter rotating  opposed chaindrive injectors used in well intervention and drilling operations utilize a tubing guide arch  located directly above the injector  the tubing guide arch supports the tubing through the       bending radius and guides the ct from the service reel into the injector chains  the tubing guide arch assembly may incorporate a series of rollers along the arch to support the tubing or may be equipped with a fluoropolymer type slide pad run along the length of the arch  the tubing guide arch should also include a series of secondary rollers mounted above the ct to center the tubing as it travels over the guide arch  the number  size  material  and spacing of the rollers can vary significantly with different tubing guide arch designs   for ct used repeatedly in well intervention and drilling applications  the radius of the tubing guide arch should be at least    times the specified od of the ct in service  this factor may be less for ct that will be bend cycled only a few times  such as in permanent installations  the continuous length tubing should enter and exit the tubing guide arch tangent to the curve formed by the gu

for measurements  measurement methods  treatment of data from the measurements     reliability of measurements     proper sampling of rocks for measurements is most important for ensuring the reliability of relative permeability and capillary pressure data  if samples are obtained improperly  costly and reliable methods for measuring rock fluid properties may no longer be necessary or suitable  the goal of sampling should be to avoid or minimize mechanical and chemical damage to the rock  mechanical and chemical damage can occur during any of four steps in the sampling process    coring and core retrieval  shipping and storing  cutting samples from the core  cleaning and preparing the sample  with all of these opportunities  some damage is inevitable   it should be obvious that reliable data require good measurement methods and correct treatment of the data obtained  but defining  quot good quot  and  quot correct quot  requires some not so obvious understanding   a goal of this discussion is to touch on the important issues  measurement of relative permeability and capillary pressure relationships is complicated  particularly because of the intertwining nature

practices will alter the porous structure and wettability of rock samples  which in turn will alter the quality of measurements  the most appropriate procedures depend on the ultimate objective of sample analysis  if the sample is to be used only for porosity and permeability measurement  wettability alterations during handling are not important  but for capillary pressure and relative

a metallic foil and a wax coated fabric  some core has been frozen immediately with dry ice or liquid nitrogen upon arrival at the surface  then shipped in a frozen condition to prevent oxidative and bacterial actions and to minimize evaporation of the water or oil       sample collection      selection of the locations in the core for taking samples is a critical step  for porosity and permeability testing  samples are usually collected at regular intervals  e g   every foot   sometimes  the most homogeneous samples are selected  such a bias likely imposes an undesirable bias on the results  selecting locations for sampling should follow a logical or a statistical thought process  for example  criteria for sample selection can include    mineralogy  pore structure  homogeneity or heterogeneity  porosity  permeability  computerized tomography  ct  scanning can help the selection of samples without internal pebbles or fractures that might drastically affect the outcome of

substantial fraction of the total drilling costs  particularly offshore  properly estimating these costs for inclusion in an authority for expenditure  afe  is important      overview     consider drilling and completing the well in    fig       in    days and use the rig costs shown in    table      for purposes of this example    file devol      final page     image      png    fig      depth

casing  mud  and logging   with the exception of the rig cost   case   uses the same well in an offshore environment  resulting in the need for a jackup rig  as a result  it is easily seen that careful attention must be given to defining cost for the drilling rig and tools      move in and move out     moving the rig into the location before drilling the well and out of the location after it is completed can be a substantial cost item  jack up rigs require a fleet of tugboats  while drillships may be able to move themselves onto the location  many states have published tariffs that specify the allowable trucking charges for various types of moves  large land rigs are normally transported by truck to the location  generally  iadc type   and   rigs are sufficiently large that they must be transported piecewise by truck  types   and   are usually truck mounted rigs  which reduces the moving time and associated trucking requirements   procedures for estimating rig cost can be developed with the rig cost and average moving times  a survey of numerous drilling contractors showed that type   and   rigs usually require approximately   days for move in  rig up  rig down  and move out  type   and    rigs required   days for land and offshore rates  although the elements of this time value are different  i e   land rigs are transported by truck while jackups are towed by boat    the cost for move in and move out is estimated as the standby rig rate over the moving time    or   days   the standby rate is slightly less than the day rate for drilling and may include support services  such as crewboats  that would be required for normal drilling operations  this method for estimating the rig moving costs is effective and reasonably accurate  it is not useful  however  in unusual circumstances  such as overseas rig moves and drillsites  requiring helicopter transportation      footage bid     many operators prefer to drill on a footage or turnkey basis  the drilling contractor provides a bid to drill the well to a certain depth  or until a certain event  such as encountering a particular formation  kickoff point  or geopressure  footage contracts may call for drilling and casing a certain size hole through or to the expected pay zone  contract clauses may allow reversion to day work  flat rate per day   if a marked increase in drilling hazards  loss of circulation  kick  etc   occurs  for example  abc oil co  may contract xyz drilling co  to drill a well to        ft for a flat fee of u s         ft  the drilling company is responsible for all well operations until the contracted depth is reached   the footage contract defines cost responsibilities for both parties  the operator may pay for all pipe  cement  logging  and mud cost  the contractor is responsible for all rig associated costs such as move in and move out  drilling time  and bits  at the target depth or operation  all costs and operational responsibilities revert to the operator   this contract arrangement can offer significant advantages to both parties  operators are not required to staff a drilling department for drilling a single well or a few wells  the drilling contractor  with proper bid preparation and efficient drilling practices  can gain a greater profit than while on straight day work rates  possible problem areas for the drilling contractor include    mechanical breakdowns creating unexpected costs   poor well planning   geological anomalies      force majeure    situations      day work bid     perhaps the most common drilling contract is the day work rate  the contractor furnishes the rig at a contracted cost per day  the operator directs all drilling activities and is responsible for the well being of the hole  the rig may be with or without crews or drillpipe  in addition  options such as high pressure blowout preventers  bops  or sophisticated solids control equipment required by the operator must be furnished at his own expense   rig selection and cost depend on the well  although rigs are often rated by their capability to drill to a certain depth  the controlling criterion is usually the casing running capability  i e   derrick and substucture capacity   a rig rated for        ft of drilling may not be capable of running        ft of heavy      i

transfer the weight of the well to the seabed and provide a disconnect and reconnect capability became clearly beneficial  this series of hangers  called mudline suspension equipment  provides landing

and mudline hanger is run  the hanger is positioned in the casing string to land on a landing shoulder inside the mudline hanger that was installed with the previous casing string  each of the mudline hangers have casing and a mudline hanger running tool made up to it  these running tools are released through right hand rotation to allow disconnect from the well  the threads on the mudline hanger

both vertically and laterally  hence  many production wells may not have any of the gas cap directly over them initially  until the gas cap extends over the whole of the oil column and its producing wells  because of the pressure differential between the gas cap and the area around the producing wells  the downdip oil production will result in the gas cap moving rapidly along the top of the structure to provide pressure support to the whole oil column  when this happens  if the reservoir is a dipping structure  the gas cap is described as  quot draping quot  over the oil column  if the oil reservoir is an anticlinal structure  then this process is often described as the gas cap having expanded to form an  quot umbrella quot  over the whole oil column  once the gas cap drape or umbrella has formed  the continued downward movement of the gas cap at each location can be stabilized     fig   simon  a d  and petersen  e j        reservoir management of the prudhoe bay field

syngas generation      the first step in a gtl process is to convert the natural gas feed into synthesis gas or syngas  before being fed to the syngas generation unit  the natural gas is typically processed to remove impurities such as    sulfides  mercaptans  mercury  any impurities that will poison the various catalysts that are used in the gtl conversion steps  the cleaned feed gas is then fed to a syngas generation unit  in this step  the bond between the carbon and hydrogen is broken  and two separate molecules  co and h   are formed  the ratio of h  to co in the syngas is a critical factor in the ft process   there are several ways to produce synthesis gas from natural gas and air or oxygen  these include steam reforming of feedstock in the presence of a catalyst   rtenotitle  and the partial oxidation process in which air or oxygen is burned together with natural gas at high temperatures and pressure  no catalyst is used   rtenotitle  for gtl plants that require large quantities of oxygen  a cryogenic air separation plant is currently the most economical option  natural gas and oxygen are preheated and compressed  if necessary  to required conditions before being sent to the synthesis gas reactor   another method is autothermal reforming  which involves partial oxidation  coupled with steam reforming   rtenotitle  the syngas fed to the downstream ft synthesis unit must have a ratio of h  to co of approximately    this ratio has favored the development of partial oxidation and autothermal reformer  atr  processes  by themselves or in combination with other processes  over the steam reforming process because the latter requires additional processing to achieve the desired h  co product ratio  even though the technology for syngas generation is considered

temperature categories       medium temperature category      the medium temperature category covers deeper well applications with natural  higher temperature reservoir conditions ranging from     c       f  to          c       f   field experience has proved that progressive cavity  pc  pumps can be used successfully in wells producing fluids within this temperature range if the fluid temperatures remain relatively constant  however  to achieve reasonable run lives in such wells  additional attention must be given to elastomer and pump model selection  pump sizing practices  and system operation  the importance of these considerations rises substantially as temperatures increase toward the higher end of this range  in such applications  some additional investigations should be undertaken to assess the effects that elevated temperatures may have on the compatibility of the selected elastomer and the produced fluids  stator elastomer debonding problems may be encountered in wells producing high water cut fluids at bottomhole temperatures exceeding         c       f        high temperature category      applications that fall into the high temperature category  temperatures  gt       c       f   include many geothermal wells and most thermal recovery operations  thermal operations include    mature steamfloods in which the temperatures are also relatively constant but may be as high as      c       f   cyclic steam operations in which the temperatures can be even higher and typically change substantially  steam assisted gravity drainage wells  which may operate over a wide range of high temperature and  pressure conditions       issues       currently  such high temperature applications pose significant challenges to routine pcp system use  and most of the relevant experience to date has been acquired through various experimental projects  although the results from high temperature tests conducted recently by various pc pump manufacturers under controlled laboratory conditions have shown considerable improvement and promise  caution is warranted in translating such results to a field application because other factors besides temperature may affect performance under the downhole operating conditions  nevertheless  given the potential market  both equipment manufacturers and operators continue to actively pursue alternative pump design and elastomer developments to effectively extend the service temperature range of pc pumps for such applications   although the tolerance that elastomers have for high temperatures varies significantly with formulation  the different elastomers used in pc pumps will all begin to experience permanent chemical and physical changes with continued exposure to temperatures above their respective limits  these changes may cause the elastomer to become hard  brittle  and cracked and  in some cases  to shrink  which typically results in rapid deterioration in pump performance  in addition  the susceptibility of elastomers to damaging chemical attack always increases with higher temperatures  a general assessment of the values in the product literature from several different pc pump vendors indicates that the temperature limit for nbr elastomers is typically      c       f   the limits for hnbr elastomers are      c       f   sulfur cured  and      c       f   peroxide cured   and for fkm elastomers       c       f   high temperature resistance typically comes at the expense of other desirable attributes  such as good mechanical properties  e g   abrasion resistance   and these requirements often limit elastomer selection      problems caused by temperature variation     severe problems with the sizing and performance of pc pumps are most common when the producing temperatures in a well fluctuate substantially  although different sized rotors may be interchanged to compensate for gradual temperature changes over several months  installation of pc pumps in wells in which the bottomhole temperature varies regularly by  gt      c      f  is usually not recommended       thermal expansion      the thermal expansion coefficient of elastomers is approximately an order of magnitude higher than that of steel  temperature changes cause stator elastomers to expand and contract far more than the steel tube housing or the mating steel rotor  the stator housings are also much stiffer than the elastomeric sleeve  so the thermal expansion of the elastomer leads to inward deformation and distortion of the pump cavity  the magnitude of the distortion is proportional to the elastomer thickness at any given point on the pump cross section     fig       shows the change in stator cavity geometry with increasing thermal expansion of the elastomer  it is important to understand that thermal expansion changes are independent of any fluid induced swell effects  which can exacerbate pump sizing problems

extensively in determining the compressible properties of the reservoir  the isothermal compressibility is also the reciprocal of the bulk modulus of elasticity  gas usually is the most compressible medium in the reservoir  however  care should be taken so that it is not confused with the gas deviation factor    z    which is sometimes called the compressibility factor      definition     the isothermal gas compressibility is defined as   rtenotitle                         an expression in terms of   z   and   p   for the compressibility can be derived from the real gas law   rtenotitle

treatments  the prime source of information on which to build an evaluation are the acid treatment report and the pressure and rate data during injection and falloff  the tasks of execution and evaluation go hand in hand  proper execution  quality control  and record keeping are prerequisites to the task of accurate evaluation  evaluation of unsatisfactory treatments is essential to recommending changes in chemicals and or treating techniques and procedures that will provide the best treatment for acidizing wells in the future      evaluation process     the evaluation process encompasses six major areas on which to focus when assessing job performance and acid treatment success    injection rate and pressure   final fall off pressure record   well production analysis  nodal analysis    produced fluid samples   post treatment investigation concerning damage incurred during injection  acid removal of damage  post treatment damage  precipitates   and verbal communications   recommendations for continuous improvement      measuring productivity after treatment     the most important measure of the treatment is the productivity of the well after treatment  when the productivity stabilizes at the same production rate as before treatment  the flowing bottomhole pressure should be estimated from fluid levels or from measured flowing pressures  static bottomhole pressure should be measured following any long shut in periods  a well flow analysis should show whether the designed productivity was obtained  the pressure charts from the treatment  including both accurate injection rates and recorded injection pressures  can be analyzed using transient pressure analysis to determine when or if the wellbore damage was removed by the treatment       injectivity index      an injectivity index can be calculated for the well both before and after the hf acid stage       overflush injection      the final overflush injection pressures and rates should give a fairly accurate measure of the well productivity before the well is ever returned to production  a useful source of information is the final pressure falloff after the treatment       falloff pressures      if the pressure exists at the wellhead  the falloff pressures should be recorded on site until the well goes on vacuum  if the well goes on vacuum too soon  fluid levels can be shot with a sonolog device until the level falls to near the static bottomhole pressure  these final falloff pressures can be used to estimate the wellbore condition after the acid treatment  if this analysis shows that the acid treatment removed all wellbore damage and later well production analysis shows that no post acid precipitation occurred  the treatment is potentially successful  an example of this type analysis is shown in the example provided by mcleod  mcleod  h o j        matrix acidizing  j pet technol                       spe       pa       underachieved or failed results     if the well injectivity or productivity  after the well returns to injection or production  is not close to that predicted by the falloff analysis  some damage probably occurred to the formation after the acid treatment ended  subsequent damage after the treatment may be caused by precipitation of acid reaction products in the formation or by return of fines to the wellbore with internal pore plugging at or near perforations  this is especially true in gravel packed wells  often  unsatisfactory performance results from imperfect coverage during the treatment  a change in the acid placement technique may be necessary for the next acid treatment in the field  if solid diverting agents were employed  changes in concentrations may be necessary  or perhaps another diversion technique would work better  feasibility and economic analysis from the expected well production increase determine whether these changes are worthwhile  usually  the damage during an acid treatment occurs at the time the first acid hits the formation  this first acid damage is usually caused by solids removed from the tubing walls prior to the acid reaching the formation  also  acid may react adversely with some of the minerals in the formation  and perhaps a different acid or solvent  such as acetic acid or an aromatic solvent  should be used to first contact the formation  many acid failures are caused by the elimination of needed wellbore preparations prior to the acid treatment      intended removal of damage     it is important to know that the treatment removed the damage in the wellbore during treatment as intended  if damage occurred after the treatment  steps can be taken to prevent that damage in a later treatment of that well or others in the reservoir by such steps as utilizing different additives to keep reaction products in solution  overflushing the reaction products deeper into the formation  using different acids or

perforation tunnels  filling of perforation tunnels can be accomplished either with a dedicated operation before performing the gravel pack or simultaneously with it  the technique used is normally dictated by well parameters      cased hole gravel packs     gravel packing cased hole completions in vertical and deviated wells are more common than openhole completions  particularly in shaley reservoirs  reasons for this are several fold    cased hole completions are the norm in almost any development because the reservoir is usually easier to manage  so remedial operations are simplified  wellbore stability issues are minimal  if multiple intervals are involved  openhole completions will not provide the necessary isolation  however  cased hole gravel packs have an important requirement that is easily overlooked  the perforations must be prepacked with gravel if productivity and completion longevity is desired penberthy  w l  jr  and shaughnessy  c m        sand control

through the perforations occurs when they are prepacked  lower pressure losses across the perforation not only affect flow from the reservoir  but the larger wellbore pressure provides additional inflow pressure to lift fluids to the surface  cased hole gravel packs that have not been prepacked are usually damaged  there is no remedial treatment that can remove the damage  a frac pack can bypass the damage   leading to a well that will be permanently restricted unless a workover is performed to prepack the completions and complete the well properly     table      verifies this scenario

frequency induction welding without the addition of filler metal  coiled tubing can be used in well intervention  and more recently  in drilling operations      manufacturing process     the first step in the typical ct manufacturing process involves the acquisition of steel stock supplied in     to    in  wide sheets that are wrapped onto a    master coil    to a nominal weight of approximately        lbm  as a result  the lengths of sheet steel will vary depending upon the wall thickness  for example  a    in  wide sheet of steel having a wall thickness of       in  rolled to a length of       ft will weigh approximately        lbm  if the    in  wide sheet steel has a wall thickness of       in   a        lbm master coil will have a length of approximately       ft   when the diameter of the ct is selected  the sheet steel on the master coil is    slit    into a continuous strip of a specific width to form the circumference of the specified tube  the flat skelp is then welded to another segment of skelp to form a continuous length of steel  the welded area is dressed off smooth  cleaned  and then x ray inspected to ensure that the weld is free from defects  once a sufficient length of the continuous skelp steel is rolled onto the skelp take up reel  the tube milling process can begin   the skelp is then run through a series of roller dies that mechanically work the flat steel into the shape of a tube  at a point immediately ahead of the last set of forming rollers  the edges of the tube walls are positioned very close to each other  these edges are then joined together by an electric welding process described as    high frequency induction     hfi  welding  the hfi coil generates the heat for welding by the resistance to flow of electric current  as the tube is run through the high frequency induction coil positioned inches ahead of the forming rollers  the edges of the walls are heated to the temperature needed to create the seam weld when pressed together within the last set of forming rollers   the weld flash exposed on the outside of the tube is removed  and the welded seam is annealed  the tube is allowed to cool in air and then within a liquid bath before passing through a nondestructive inspection station to inspect the tube body  the inspection is typically performed with an eddy current device that creates a magnetic field around the tube body and looks for distortions in the field created by surface defects in the tube body   the manufacturing process continues as the tube is run through a sizing mill that slightly reduces the diameter after welding and works the tubing to the required outside diameter  od  and roundness tolerances  at this time  the tubing undergoes full body heat treatment using induction coils  the purpose of the heat treatment is to stress relieve the entire tube  increasing the ductility of the steel  the tube is allowed to cool  first gradually in air and then within a liquid bath  this process results in the development of pearlite and ferrite grain sizes within the steel microstructure  the final product is a high strength ct string with ductility and physical properties appropriate for the specified yield range  the tube is then spooled onto a steel or wooden take up reel and subjected to a hydrostatic pressure test using water treated with corrosion inhibitors   alternative ct manufacturing processes may require that a string be constructed by butt welding sections of tube together  the tube to tube welding technique may be performed using tig or mig  tungsten inert gas or metal inert gas  welding practices  and each weld should be inspected using radiographic inspection  x ray  or ultrasonic inspection to evaluate the quality of the weld  note that the exterior surface of the tube to tube weld may or may not be dressed off and that the weld bead on the inside diameter  id  surface is not disturbed in any way  the string of tubing is then spooled onto the service reel or shipping reel as required   all manufactured spools of ct are given a unique identification number that is assigned at the time of manufacture  documentation for each spool of ct should include    the identification number  od of the tubing  material grade  wall thickness es   weld positions  total length  a spool of ct may be manufactured from one heat or a combination of heats that are selected according to a documented procedure provided by the manufacturer  however  the steel used to fabricate the string must have a uniform material yield strength throughout  the manufacturer should maintain traceability of the ct product throughout the manufacturing and testing process  the requirements of the purchaser often include traceability to the heat

most of the parameters are relatively fixed by the geology  therefore  the bhp must be controlled by either hydrostatic drilling fluid or by the choke to control reservoir inflow performance

bottom end  inside the cage is a thermistor that senses the surrounding fluid temperature  the preferred sensor is a platinum element because the electrical resistance of the sensor varies linearly

also input to a differentiating amplifier  the output of the amplifier is recorded as trace    the differential trace or the derivative of the temperature   and is proportional to the depth rate of change of the temperature curve  although no absolute scale is associated with the differential trace  it is useful for highlighting important changes of the slope of the temperature curve   on the log  the temperature trace warms abruptly below depth b  because the tool is logging down and the temperature is increasing  the depth rate of change of temperature is positive  consequently the differential trace shows a strong positive excursion at b  highlighting the change of the slope of the temperature trace at this depth  the differential trace  when properly amplified as on    fig        is easily worth the additional logging charge   the flowing temperature trace   in    fig       also provides information on the production profile  production commences at depth a  where the flowing trace  quot stands up quot  to separate to the warm side of static  this location is at the bottom of the bottom set of perforations  the middle set of perforations  on the other hand  contributes nothing to the production  the largest contribution comes from near the bottom of the top set of perforations at depth b  where a large mixing signature is evident  the volumetric rate of entry here is so large that the mixture temperature is  quot pulled quot  almost back to static temperature  i e   to the entry temperature for the stream   there is one additional smaller entry at depth c  whose mixing signature is hardly recognizable on the flowing trace   but is clearly evident on the differential trace    the location of this entry suggests that it is composed primarily of oil  the temperature traces therefore show that the top set of perforations is responsible for the majority of both water  the major stream  and oil  the minor stream   the use of these mixing signatures to profile both single phase and multiphase flow is described in detail in the production logging application tables under production well profiling  the important point is that the size of a mixing signature relative to static temperature is dependent upon the thermal content  product of density  specific heat  and volumetric rate  both of the entry stream and of the stream in the casing immediately below the entry      digital recording     in digital recording  the spikes per minute from the logging cable are counted digitally at the surface  and the resulting count rate is converted to a temperature trace by the computer   s program  again  the temperature trace should be recorded at a sensitivity of    f across the chart  digital recording degrades the sensitivity of the differential trace from that available with analog recording  thus  the digitally determined differential trace is not as useful for highlighting important changes of the temperature curve   s slope   depending on how carefully  or recently  a particular temperature tool was calibrated  there may be several   f difference between the recorded temperature and the true downhole temperature  however  the difference does not degrade the sensitivity of the differential trace  provided that the temperature curve is recorded at the recommended sensitivity of    f in  across the chart  and that the temperature log is carefully depth correlated  the resulting temperature curve has more vertical resolution than does a curve from any other production logging tools   the temperature tool is most effective when located at the bottom of a tool string  in a production well  the tool should always be logged downward so as to enter undisturbed fluid  the log should be recorded at a constant logging speed not to exceed    ft min  with digital recording  the maximum logging speed should be reduced to    ft min      temper

lies in the pore size distribution  because most of the surface area is contributed by the smallest grains  pores   measures of surface area emphasize the small end of the pore size spectrum  yet  the small pores contribute least to permeability  the high        power of porosity serves to unweight the contribution of the small pores  in the surface area models  porosity serves a dual role  first

small pores at lower porosities  moreover  the retention of a sorting term in eqs   a and  b of estimating permeability based on grain size is inadequate compensation for small pores  even though a

modifications because of the high temperatures and the much higher flow rates needed for economic production   exploration begins with selection of an appropriate area based on general knowledge of areas with above average heat flow  the best guides for more detailed investigation are the presence of thermal springs  the equivalent of oil seeps   however  to develop undiscovered resources  geologists must rely on other techniques  because the target is a region of above average temperature  heat flow studies can indicate elevated subsurface temperatures  among other methods being used and investigated for regional exploration are remote sensing of elevation changes  age of faulting  and geochemical techniques   hydrothermal systems suitable for geothermal development must have adequate temperature and sufficient flow for economic production  geochemical techniques can be used to determine subsurface temperatures when hot springs are present  and shallow temperature gradient holes can be used to project subsurface temperatures below the level of drilling  geophysical tools are also used to determine the approximate size of the reservoir  because high flow rates are needed for geothermal production  most geothermal production comes from highly fractured reservoirs  geophysical methods that can determine fracture intensity are of great importance to the explorationist      geochemical studies     the interpretation of the chemistry of hot springs and fumaroles is an important tool used in geothermal exploration  the solubility of minerals strongly depends on temperature  and the kinetic rate of rock water reactions is relatively slow  thus  water equilibrated with rocks in a geothermal system can retain their dissolved mineral content as they move to the surface  and the composition of hot springs can be used to determine the temperature of equilibration  the geochemistry of thermal springs is the most widely used geothermal exploration tool for estimating subsurface temperatures prior to drilling wells the most widely used geothermometer is based on the solubility of silica  because more than one form of silica  with different solubilities  can be present in the subsurface  caution must be used in applying the thermometer  the two most common forms of silica in geothermal systems yield the following composition temperature relationships

intended to develop and explain features of both data and probability distributions  we begin the discussion with data  perhaps visualized as collections of numbers expressing possible values of some set of variables  but it is common practice to extend the language to three common types of graphs used to relate variables to probability    histograms  probability density functions  cumulative distributions  we habitually use the same words  mean  median  standard deviation  and so on  in the context of data as well as for these graphs  in so doing  we create an additional opportunity for miscommunication  although we require only a few words and phrases from a lexicon of statistics and probability  it is essential that we use them carefully      example data     there is an unspoken objective when we start with data  we imagine the data as a sample from some abstract population  and we wish to describe the population  we use simple algebraic formulas to obtain various statistics or descriptors of the data  in hopes of inferring what the underlying population  i e   reality  nature  the truth  might look like  consider  for example  the database in    table      for    shallow gas wells in a given field    pay thickness  porosity  reservoir temperature  initial pressure  water saturation  estimated ultimate recovery  eur    file vol  page     image      png    table     data from    shallow gas wells      we can use various functions in excel to describe this set of data  the    underlying populations    in this case would refer to the corresponding data for all the wells we could drill in the field  what follows concentrates on the porosities as an example  but one may substitute any of the other six parameters      measures of central tendency     our first group of statistics helps us find    typical    values of the data  called measures of central tendency  let us calculate the three common ones      mean     sum the    values and divide by     nicknames  arithmetic mean  expected value  average  arithmetic average   the excel name is    average     the mean porosity is            median     first sort the    values in ascending order and take the average of the two middle values    th and   th numbers in the ascending list   for an odd number of data  the median is the middle value once sorted  nickname  p     p   is not the probability at the   th percentile  p   is a value on the other axis  the excel function is    median     the median porosity is        the rule works regardless of repeated data values      mode     find the number that repeats most often  in case of a tie  report all tied values  the excel function is    mode     because excel reports only one number in case of a tie  namely the one that appears first in the list as entered in a column or row  note that it reports the mode of the porosity data as       because that value appeared five times  even though the value       also appeared five times   we therefore see that the mode is ambiguous  rather than one number  there may be several  in excel we get a different value by simply recording the data in a different order  this situation can be confusing  we seldom use the mode of data in a serious way because what we care about is the underlying population   s mode  and the mode of the sample data available is generally not a good estimator  fitting a theoretical curve to data and then finding the  unique  mode of the fitted curve is a relatively unambiguous process  except for the possibility of competing curves with slightly different modes   these three values   mean  median  and mode   are referred to as measures of central tendency  each one   s reaction to changes in the data set determines when it is used  the mean is influenced by the extreme values  whereas the median and mode are not  thus  one or more very large values cause the mean to drift toward those values  changing the largest or smallest values does not affect the median  and seldom the mode  but would alter the mean  the mode and median are insensitive to data perturbations because they are based more on the rank  or order  of the numbers rather than the values themselves   the median is often used to report salaries and house prices  allowing people to see where they fit relative to the    middle     newspapers report housing prices in major cities periodically  for instance     table      appeared in the houston chronicle to compare prices in five major cities in texas  the mean values are roughly     larger than the median  reflecting

plutonium beryllium  and a single detector  many variations were produced exploiting both thermal and epithermal neutrons  in most of the early tools  neutrons were not detected directly  instead  the tools counted gamma rays emitted when hydrogen and chlorine capture thermal neutrons  because hydrogen has by far the greatest effect on neutron transport  the borehole effects on such a tool are large  the now standard compensated neutron porosity logging  cnl  tool  in common use since the     s  is still a very simple tool  like a density tool  it consists of an isotopic source  now most often americium beryllium  although at least one tool uses an accelerator source  and two neutron detectors  the tool measures the size of the neutron cloud by characterizing the falloff of neutrons between the two detectors  because neutrons penetrate considerably further than gamma rays  the design is much simpler than that of a density tool  it requires little collimation and does not need to be pressed against the borehole wall  the size of the fluid filled borehole is obviously an important environmental effect that must be taken into account  as a result  even  quot raw quot  cnl porosities are reported with a borehole size correction already applied      neutron scattering porosity tools     by far  the most difficult nuclear logs to interpret are those that exploit neutron scattering to estimate porosity  the log targets the average hydrogen density of the volume investigation  if all the hydrogen in the formation is in the form of porosity filling liquid  in particular water or oil  the hydrogen index will track the porosity  a modern  compensated tool actually estimates the size of a cloud of neutrons around a source by measuring the ratio of count rates at two different distances from the source  the straight line distance that the average neutron travels away from the source before collisions with formation atoms slow it down to thermal energy sets the size of the neutron cloud  once a neutron slows to thermal energy and is thus in equilibrium with the rock matrix  it diffuses only very slowly away from the source  this forms the static cloud of neutrons whose size the tool measures  this characteristic distance is called the slowing down length  neutrons slow down through elastic  billiard ball type collisions  conservation of momentum requires that they lose the most speed in collisions with nuclei of nearly their own mass  e g   hydrogen   obviously  collisions with other nuclei also slow neutrons  but less effectively than those with hydrogen     table      summarizes just how dominant hydrogen is at slowing down neutrons compared to the other common formation elements  ideally  a porosity tool would count only epithermal neutrons because the slower thermal neutron population depends as much on the absorption cross section of the formation as it does on the slowing down length  to get count rates high enough for statistical accuracy  logging tools typically count all neutrons  epithermal and thermal  thus  the tool reading must be corrected for the effects of neutron capture in the formation     fig       outlines the conversion from tool reading to porosity    file vol  page      image      png    fig        the nuclear log interpretation process can be seen as a chain of inferences  as illustrated by the neutron porosity log          neutron log interpretation     because we are stuck with values reported in apparent neutron porosity  that is how we typically interpret them  most interpretation schemes assume that the neutron porosity is scaled in apparent limestone units  that means a limestone matrix and water filled porosity  if the neutron matrix is not known for certain  but the actual formation matrix is  the matrix on which the neutron porosity log was recorded can be verified by making a density neutron crossplot     fig       shows a schematic example  if the points fall along the overlay line for the actual formation matrix  the neutron log is most likely in limestone  calcite  units  if the points fall along the calcite overlay line  the log matrix is the same as the formation matrix  in particular  if the points fall along the limestone line and the reservoir is known to be sandstone  the neutron log is in sandstone units and should be transformed to limestone units before proceeding with interpretation  as the schematic shows  gas and shale can obscure these trends    file vol  page      image      png    fig        neutron density crossplot showing where

the same aquifer  changes may be brought about by the intrusion of other waters and by discharge from and recharge to the aquifer  as a reservoir is produced  the compositions typically change with time  therefore  it is difficult  but important  to obtain a representative sample of a given subsurface body of water  any one sample is a very small part of the total mass  which may vary widely in composition  therefore  it is generally necessary to obtain and analyze many samples  also  the samples themselves may change with time as gases evolve from solution or may precipitate solids when coming to ambient conditions  the sampling sites should be selected to fit into a comprehensive network to cover an oil productive basin  in which case the information is of value in both exploration and production  this page discusses sampling and analysis of oilfield  produced  water      need for periodic sampling     water compositions from particular wells change over time  so a periodic sampling program is needed  the sampling frequency needed is not universal  the best guideline is the particular field itself  the faster the composition changes  the more often the water needs sampling  fields undergoing waterflood or tertiary recovery naturally show water chemistry changes as the injected water mixes with the formation water  reservoirs under primary production can show dilution from water moving from adjacent compacting clay beds into the petroleum reservoir as the pressure declines because of the removal of oil  gas  and brine  this can be a detector for possible subsidence of the reservoir and perhaps the surface  the composition of oilfield water can vary with the position within the geologic structure from which it is obtained  in some cases  the salinity will increase upstructure to a maximum at the point of oil water contact      water sampling methods     various techniques and devices are now available for the evaluation of newly drilled wells  but there remain some important factors that must be considered when obtaining these samples and evaluating the results  the primary problem stems from the contamination of the reservoir with the drilling  completion  and stimulation fluids used during the well construction operation  the contamination is usually easily detected from the analytical results  if one realizes that high concentrations of particular species that were used in those wellbore fluids appear in the water analysis results  then the sample was likely contaminated and the usefulness of the sample reduced accordingly  naturally  one must always include these species in the analysis  unfortunately  if a sample is contaminated there is seldom an opportunity to re enter the hole and obtain a new sample  except at great cost   one approach for a standard drillstem test  dst  is to sample the water after each stand of pipe is removed  normally  the total dissolved solids  tds  content will increase downward  becoming constant when pure formation water is obtained  a test that flows water improves the chances of an uncontaminated sample  otherwise  the best chance is to sample just above the dst tool  because this was the last water to enter the tool  newer downhole samplers sometimes allow multiple samples to be obtained  therefore  if one first pulls a large volume of water into the tool and then a second  or third  sample from the same interval  there is a chance of getting uncontaminated water in that sample   for example  analyses of water obtained from a dst of smackover limestone water in rains county  texas  demonstrates the errors caused by improper sampling of dst water  analyses of top  middle  and bottom samples taken from a    ft zone of fluid recovery show an increase in salinity with depth

types  normally are run while the tubing is installed in the well  where significant wall loss is observed  the tubing can be pulled and the damaged joints replaced   hydrostatic  a commonly used inspection method is to test hydrostatically the tubing body and joint internally with water  test pressures are usually based on     of internal yield  hydrostatic tests of the body are performed on the pipe rack on location and the joints checked while running  however  both can be tested while running  a more stringent test of the joints is obtained by the use of nitrogen with a helium tracer rather than water   electromagnetic  to find pits  transverse and or longitudinal defects in the pipe body  electromagnetic search coils  which find magnetic flux leakage  are typically used  this technique works for a uniform body and will typically not find defects in the upset and or threaded area of the tube  the inspection equipment must be in good working order and an experienced and qualified operator is required  eddy current  another electromagnetic inspection method  is used for grade verification   magnetic particle  the magnetic particle inspection methods  both wet and dry  induce either a longitudinal or transverse magnetic field in the tubing and magnetic iron particles dusted on the tubing align at defects  this method is normally used to check the outside surface of

high frequency sound  is used to find flaws and imperfections in the pipe body wall  the tool is usually stationary and the pipe is rotated and fed mechanically to examine the entire tubing body  the ultrasonic testing equipment must be in good working condition and an experienced and qualified operator is mandatory   hardness testing  the hardness of tubing is often checked when it is to be used in sour service to ensure the tubing meets   api spec   ct   or to sort mixed grades of tubing       inspecting used tubing      used tubing should be classified according to loss of nominal wall thickness  api   rp  c    specifies color coding to indicate thickness  the color coding should consist of a paint band of the appropriate color approximately   in  wide around the body of the pipe

further advancement of logging technologies   the first is the need for improved reservoir characterization to help us deal with problematic reservoirs that have low permeability characteristics  thin beds  laminations  low resistivity contrast pay  and fracture networks  fracture networks lead us to the question of carbonates and their petrophysical differences from clastic rocks  one might ask why it is that with so much technology available  the industry still perceives a shortfall in its interpretative capability  the reason is that recent attention has been directed at data acquisition and management rather than methods of interpreting the data themselves  thus  for example  we have not yet succeeded in reconciling petrophysical data measured at different scales  the gap between our ability to measure and our ability to interpret the measurements widened still further during the     s  the decade of the horizontal well  this drove the analysis of downhole measurements further into three dimensions and emphasized the need for us to get more out of our data if our reservoir models are to deliver the greatest benefit   the second technology driver is the cost effectiveness of

pressure and temperature conditions  gases can be considered ideal gases  which can distinguish them from what we consider real gases  treating a gas as an ideal gas often greatly simplifies the mathematical formulations behind the calculations of gas properties  this page will provide a brief overview of certain fundamental gas properties      molecular weight     molecules of a particular chemical species are composed of groups of atoms that always combine according to a specific formula  the chemical formula and the international atomic weight table provide us with a scale for determining the weight ratios of all atoms combined in any molecule  the molecular weight    m    of a molecule is simply the sum of all the atomic weights of its constituent atoms  it follows  then  that the number of molecules in a given mass of material is inversely proportional to its molecular weight  therefore  when masses of different materials have the same ratio as their molecular weights  the number of molecules present is equal  for instance    lbm hydrogen contains the same number of molecules as    lbm methane  for this reason  it is convenient to define the unit  quot lbm mol quot  as a mass of the material in pounds equal to its molecular weight  similarly  a  quot g mol quot  is its mass in grams  one lbm mol or one g mol of any compound  therefore  represents a fixed number of molecules  this number for the g mol was determined in      by the us national institute of standards and technology to be                   the number of significant digits shown is the accuracy to which it has been determined experimentally      critical temperature and pressure     typical pressure volume temperature  pvt  relationships for a pure fluid are illustrated in    fig        the curve segment b c d defines the limits of vapor liquid coexistence  with b c being the bubblepoint curve of the liquid and c d being the dewpoint curve of the vapor  any combination of temperature  pressure  and volume above that line segment indicates that the fluid exists in a single phase  at low temperatures and pressures  the properties of equilibrium vapors and liquids are extremely different  e g   the density of a gas is low  while that of a liquid is relatively high   as the pressure and temperature are increased along the coexistence curves  liquid density  viscosity  and other properties generally decrease while vapor density and viscosity generally increase  thus  the difference in the physical properties of the coexisting phases decreases  these changes continue as the temperature and pressure are raised until a point is reached at which the properties of the equilibrium vapor and liquid become equal  the temperature  pressure  and volume at this point are called the  quot critical quot  values for that species  location c on    fig       is the critical point  the critical temperature and pressure are unique values for each species and are useful in correlating physical properties  critical constants for some of the commonly occurring hydrocarbons and other components of natural gas can be found in    table         file vol  page     image      png    fig        a typical pressure volume diagram for pure components      file vol  page     image      png    table     some physical constants of hydrocarbons          specific gravity  relative density      the specific gravity of a gas          is the ratio of the density of the gas at standard pressure and temperature to the density of air at the same standard pressure and temperature  the standard temperature is usually     f  and the standard pressure is usually        psia  however  slightly different standards are sometimes used in different locations and in different units  the ideal gas laws can be used to show that the specific gravity  ratio of densities  is also equal to the ratio of the molecular weights  by convention  specific gravities of all gases at all pressures are usually set equal to the ratio of the molecular weight of the gas to that of air           although specific gravity is still frequently used  this traditional term is not used under the si system  it has been replaced by  quot relative density  quot       mole fraction and apparent molecular weight of gas mixtures      the analysis of a gas mixture can be expressed in terms of a mole fraction    y    i    of each component  which is the ratio of the number of moles of a given component to the total number of moles present  analyses also can be expressed in terms of the volume  weight  or pressure fraction of each component present  under limited conditions  where gaseous mixtures conform reasonably well to the ideal gas laws  the mole fraction can be shown to be equal to the volume fraction but not to the weight fraction  the apparent molecular weight of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of the mole

primary rates is water injection  commonly referred to as secondary oil recovery  common practice in the industry is to refer to all other methods as tertiary enhanced oil recovery  according to prats prats  m        thermal recovery  no     richardson  texas  monograph series  spe  thermal enhanced oil recovery  teor  is a family of tertiary processes defined as  quot any process in which heat is introduced intentionally into a subsurface accumulation of organic compounds for the purpose of recovering fuels through wells  quot  by far  the most common vehicle used to inject heat is saturated

refers to the general process as steam enhanced oil recovery  seor        properties of saturated steam      like other substances  water can exist in the form of a solid  ice   as a liquid  water   or as a gas  loosely called steam   seor processes are concerned with the liquid and gas phases  and the change from one phase to the other  the phase change region  in which water coexists as liquid and gas  is where our interest lies when considering steam for use in the oil field  the term  quot steam quot  is an imprecise designation because it refers to a water liquid gas system that can exist from     f to any higher temperature  from     psia to any higher pressure  and from nearly all liquid to      gas  steam quality refers to the phase change region of liquid to gas and is

 all liquids and solids are compared to pure water  which has the highest heat capacity of any substance at   btu  lbm   f   by calculating a ratio of the heat capacity of water divided by that of another substance  a convenient fraction called  quot specific heat quot  is obtained  notice that petroleum has a specific heat of      or half that of water  and sandstone is only     of water on a per pound basis  no other liquid or gas carries as much heat per pound as water  also  the temperature range at which this high heat carrying performance is achieved     to      f  is ideal for many processes  including seor enthalpy is a useful property defined by an arbitrary combination of other properties and is not a true form of energy  the absolute value of enthalpy is of no practical value  changes in enthalpy are extremely useful  however  and are the basis for seor energy calculations  the total enthalpy held by each pound of liquid water at any temperature is called sensible heat    h    f    the heat input  which produces a change of state from liquid to gas without a change of temperature  is called the  quot latent heat of evaporation quot  and is shown by   h    fv    the total heat    h    v    in each pound of      quality or saturated steam is the sum of these two    h    v       h    f       h    fv   in the phase change or  quot saturation quot  region  steam can only exist at one temperature for a given pressure regardless of quality or latent heat content  as shown in    fig            steam increases in volume as latent heat increases  as in    fig

measurement of the mass flow rate of gases  such as natural gas for custody transfer applications  is now a reality      international standards     this has been reflected by the large acceptance of this technology within the natural gas industry  as an example  micormotion has supplied       coriolis meters for natural gas applications in the last   years  this industrial acceptance motivated iso to develop a standard through the iso technical committee   iso   standard tc   sc      iso standard tc   sc    measurement of fluid flow in closed conduits   mass methods        geneva  switzerland  iso technical committee  in addition to this iso standard  there is also an engineering technical report prepared by aga entitled   coriolis flow measurement for natural gas applications    coriolis flow measurement for natural gas applications  technical report        washington  dc  aga   for additional information on coriolis meters and their use in liquid service  see inference liquid meters   although there is no iso standard for natural gas measurement using coriolis measurement  some countries have issued type approval certificates for natural gas measurement using coriolis meters  these countries include  the netherlands  netherlands inst  for metrology and technology   germany  physickalisch technische burdessarstalt   canada  measurement canada   and russia  gosstandard       coriolis meter overview     a coriolis meter comprises two main parts    a sensor  primary element   a transmitter  secondary element   see    fig          file vol  page     image      png    fig      coriolis flowmeter  courtesy of daniel industries        with this design  the gas flows through a u shaped tube  the tube is made to vibrate in a perpendicular direction to the flow  gas flow through the tube generates a coriolis force  which interacts with the vibration  causing the tube to twist  the greater the angle is twisted  the more the flow increases  the sensing coils  located on the inlet and outlet  oscillate in proportion to the sinusoidal vibration  during the flow  the vibrating tubes and gas mass flow couple together because of the coriolis force  causing a phase shift between the vibrating sensing coils  the phase shift  which is measured by the coriolis meter transmitter  is directly proportional to the mass flow rate  the vibration frequency is proportional to the flowing density of the flow  however  the density measurement from the coriolis meter is not normally used as part of the gas measurement station  like other meters  the coriolis is usually mounted in a meter tube  because the device is insensitive to flow disturbances  there is no requirement for any form of flow conditioning  straight lengths  or meter tube      theory of operation     coriolis meters operate on the principle that  if a particle inside a rotating body moves in a direction toward or away from the center of rotation  the particle generates inertial forces that act on the body  coriolis meters create a rotating motion by vibrating a tube or tubes carrying the flow  and the inertial force  coriolis force  that results is proportional to the mass flow rate  by measuring the amount of inertial force or deflection  it is possible to infer the mass flow rate  it is this phenomenon that is harnessed within the coriolis flowmeter   it is also important to consider any additional uncertainty associated with the through life stability of the coriolis meter  there are two main influencing factors  the change in flow tube structural characteristics caused by erosion of the tube wall by abrasive particles and the coating of the flow tube by debris  abrasion of the flow tubes by abrasive particles can directly affect the flow calibration of the meter  coating of the flow tubes by debris is only a concern at low fluid flow velocities when the meter is not self cleaning  this influence does not affect the meter   s calibration and only affects the meter   s zero  it can be corrected by regular zero checks for drift and zeroing  if required  both of these influences can be identified as occurring under flowing conditions by monitoring the drift in flowing density over time      advantages and disadvantages     the advantages and disadvantages for coriolis meters are shown in    table         file vol  page     image      png    table           sizing     gas coriolis meters  like all coriolis meters  are mass devices  the sensitivity of the meter to measure small amounts of mass flow determines the low end of the metering range  the upper end of the measurement range is most often determined by the largest acceptable pressure loss  the pressure loss across the meter increases with flow rate and the corresponding velocity through the meter  velocities through the meter can be a substantial fraction of the speed of sound but clearly should not exc

shift  it is used to demonstrate the basic concepts of propagation measurements  conventional induction measurements are made with mutually balanced arrays of transmitter and receiver coils operating in the kilohertz frequency range and that phase lock measurement electronics  because it was difficult to engineer this type of measurement on a steel drill collar using the technology of the early     s  a higher frequency propagation measurement was considered to be more practical for lwd  a frequency of   mhz was chosen because it was the lowest frequency at which accurate propagation measurements could be made on a drill collar at that time   the cdr tool broadcasts a   mhz electromagnetic wave  a propagation measurement is made by taking the difference between the phases  phase shift  and amplitudes  attenuation  of the voltages recorded at the two receivers  attenuation increases as a function of increasing conductivity  while the wavelength decreases as conductivity increases  thus  the two measurements are proportional to formation conductivity and can be used to generate resistivity logs  note that the cdr tool has two transmitters  the phase shift and attenuation measurements generated by the upper transmitter between the two receivers  and by the lower transmitter between the two receivers  are averaged to symmetrize the tool response  this averaging is known as borehole compensation because it also reduces the effect of borehole rugosity  the transmitter to receiver spacings for the cdr tool are    and    in   the phase shift and attenuation measurements are transformed to two independent resistivities  which for the cdr tool are known as rps  phase shift  shallow  and rad  attenuation  deep   because at   mhz dielectric effect can be significant at high resistivity levels  a dielectric correction is performed before the raw data are converted to apparent resistivity  most service companies have developed their own proprietary algorithms to perform dielectric correction  joint inversion for both resistivity and dielectric constant is also possible with today   s multiarray propagation tools  the dielectric

electromagnetic fields  and seismic technology  potential field data are valuable in many studies  but seismic data are used in more reservoir characterization and reservoir management applications  this chapter focuses on seismic fundamentals and does not consider gravity  magnetic  or electrical concepts seismic data have been used for many years to guide exploration  more recently  seismic data have been used to support reservoir characterization in field development planning and subsequent reservoir management  as the technology in equipment and interpretation techniques has advanced  so has the ability to define the size  shape  fluid content  and variation of some petrophysical properties of reservoirs  this chapter provides insight into the fundamentals of seismic data acquisition  interpretation techniques  and the types of information that can be derived  see the chapter on reservoir geophysics in the emerging and peripheral technologies section of this   handbook   for information on emerging technologies that apply geophysical data most seismic data are acquired with surface positioned sources and receivers  for the first   or   decades that seismic reflection data were acquired  sources and receivers were deployed along the same straight line to create  d seismic profiles  two dimensional seismic data do not yield a correct image of subsurface stratigraphy when a  d seismic line crosses a complex subsurface structure because the acquisition geometry cannot distinguish reflections that originate from outside the profile plane from reflections that occur within the  d vertical image plane this imaging deficiency of  d seismic profiling has been remedied by the implementation of  d seismic data acquisition  which allows data processing to migrate reflections to their correct image coordinates in  d space  industry largely abandoned  d seismic profiling in the     s and now relies almost entirely on  d seismic data acquisition  this chapter covers the basics of  d seismic technology  but does not consider  d seismic technology involving surface positioned equipment in some reservoir applications  seismic data are acquired with downhole sources and receivers  if the receiver is stationed at various depth levels in a well and the source remains on the surface  the measurement is called vertical seismic profiling  vsp   this technique produces a high resolution   d image that begins at the receiver well and extends a short distance  a few tens of meters or a few hundred meters  depending on the source offset distance  toward the source station  this image  a  d profile restricted to the vertical plane passing through the source and receiver coordinates  is useful in tying seismic responses to subsurface geologic and engineering control if the source is deployed at various depth levels in one well and the receiver is placed at several depth stations in a second well  the measurement is called crosswell seismic profiling  csp   images made from csp data have the best spatial resolution of any seismic measurement used in reservoir characterization because a wide range of frequencies is recorded  csp data are useful for creating high resolution images of interwell spaces and for monitoring fluid movements between wells  however  a csp image is also a  d profile with the image limited to the vertical plane that passes through the source and receiver coordinates  this chapter includes brief descriptions of the fundamentals of subsurface vsp and csp technologies to complement the descriptions of surface positioned seismic technology __toc__     impulsive sources     a variety of seismic sources exist that can apply vertical impulse forces to the surface of the ground  these devices are viable energy sources for onshore seismic work  included in this source category are gravity driven weight droppers and other devices that use explosive gases or compressed air to

phase of an oil field  however  in the haste to get a field on production  artificial lift may not be considered until after other production facilities are designed and installed  it is difficult to choose and install the optimum artificial lift system after the surface production facilities have been installed  this is especially true in the case of gas lift     fundamentals of gas for gas lift design   only the gas fundamentals essential to the design and analysis of gas lift installations and operations are discussed in this section  the more important gas calculations related to gas lift wells and systems can be divided into these topics    gas pressure at depth  temperature effect on the confined nitrogen charged bellows pressure  an alternative solution for calculating nitrogen charged bellows pressure at   of  volumetric gas throughput of a choke or gas lift valve port  gas volume stored within a conduit    factors having an effect on the design of a gas lift system   most production equipment affects the design of a gas lift system  so it is best to design the gas lift system concurrently with the design of surface facilities  the entire purpose of a gas lift system is to reduce the bottomhole flowing pressure of the well  anything that restricts or prevents this from occurring will have an impact on the system and must be considered in the design      field layout and well design    consideration of gas lift operations should be a prime factor in sizing the hole for the desired oilwell tubulars  this is particularly true in offshore wells where all of the downhole gas lift equipment  except the valves  is installed during the initial completion  in on shore fields  gas lift affects the size and location of gathering lines and production stations  artificial lift should be considered before a casing program is designed  casing programs should allow the maximum production rate expected from the well without restrictions  skimping on casing size can ultimately cost lost production that is many times greater than any savings from smaller pipe and hole size  the same is true in flowline size and length  production stations should be relatively near the producing wells  in most cases  increasing the size of the flowline does not compensate for the backpressure generated by the added pipe length  any item of production equipment that increases backpressure at the wellhead  whether it be wellhead chokes  small flowlines  undersized gathering manifolds and separators  or high compressor suction pressure  seriously impacts the operation of a gas lift system     fig       illustrates the effect of backpressure on injection gas requirement and fluid production in a       ft gas lift well     file vol  page     image      png    fig    effect of wellhead backpressure on daily production rates and injection gas requirements          injection gas pressure    choosing a proper injection gas pressure is critical in a gas lift system design   several factors may affect the choice of an injection gas pressure  however  one primary factor stands out above all others  to obtain the maximum benefit from the injected gas  it must be injected as near the producing interval as possible  the injection gas pressure at depth must be greater than the flowing producing pressure at the same depth  any compromise with this principle will result in less pressure drawdown and a less efficient operation  high volumes of gas injected in the upper part of the fluid column will not have the same effect as a much smaller volume of gas injected near the producing formation depth because the fluid density is reduced only above the point of gas injection    the equilibrium curve illustrates the effect of injection gas depth on a particular well  the equilibrium curve is established by determining the intersection of the formation fluid pressure gradient below the depth of gas injection with the produced gas lift gradient above the depth of gas injection for various producing liquid rates  see    fig         in    fig        the intersections of the flowing formation fluid pressure gradient traverses for a     b d rate and a     b d rate with the flowing total  formation plus injection gas   pressure gradient traverses above the point of gas injection to the surface for both rates are shown  if intersections are established for a large number of rates  as are shown in    fig        the points can be connected and will form what is referred to as an equilibrium curve  when injection gas pressure traverses are drawn from the surface  it is possible to determine the maximum gas lift rate from the well for various surface injection gas pressures  referring again to    fig        a

formation gas to lift the well fluids  the principle of gas lift is that gas injected into the tubing reduces the density of the fluids in the tubing  and the bubbles have a    scrubbing    action on the liquids  both factors act to lower the flowing bottomhole pressure  bhp  at the bottom of the tubing  there are two basic types of gas lift in use today   continuous and intermittent flow  this page briefly describes each method and its advantages and disadvantages      continuous flow gas lift     the vast majority of gas lift wells are produced by continuous flow  which is very similar to natural flow     fig       shows a schematic of a gas lift system  in continuous flow gas lift  the formation gas is supplemented with additional high pressure gas from an outside source  gas is injected continuously into the production conduit at a maximum depth that depends upon the injection gas pressure and well depth  the injection gas mixes with the produced well fluid and decreases the density and  subsequently  the flowing pressure gradient of the mixture from the point of gas injection to the surface  the decreased flowing pressure gradient reduces the flowing bottomhole pressure below the static bottomhole pressure thereby creating a pressure differential that allows the fluid to flow into the wellbore     fig       illustrates this principal    file vol  page     image

injection in a continuous flow gas lift well       continuous flow gas lift is recommended for high volume and high static bhp wells in which major pumping problems could occur with other artificial lift methods  it is an excellent application for offshore formations that have a strong waterdrive  or in waterflood reservoirs with good pis and high gas oil ratios  gors   when high pressure gas is available without compression or when gas cost is low  gas lift is especially attractive  continuous flow gas lift supplements the produced gas with additional gas injection to lower the intake pressure to the tubing  resulting in lower formation pressure as well   a reliable  adequate supply of good quality high pressure lift gas is mandatory  this supply is necessary throughout the producing life of the well if gas lift is to be maintained effectively  in many fields  the produced gas declines as water cut increases  requiring some outside source of gas  the gas lift pressure typically is fixed during the initial phase of the facility design  ideally  the system should be designed to lift from just above the producing zone  wells may produce erratically or not at all when the lift supply stops or pressure fluctuates radically  poor gas quality will impair or even stop production if it contains corrosives or excessive liquids that can cut valves or fill low spots in delivery lines  the basic requirement for gas must be met  or gas lift is not a viable lift method   continuous flow gas lift imposes a relatively high backpressure on the reservoir compared with pumping methods  therefore  production rates are reduced  also  power efficiency is not good compared with some artificial lift methods  and the poor efficiency significantly increases both initial capital cost for compression and operating energy costs       advantages      gas lift has the following advantages    gas lift is the best artificial lift method for handling sand or solid materials  many wells produce some sand even if sand control is installed  the produced sand causes few mechanical problem in the gas lift system  whereas  only a little sand plays havoc with other pumping methods  except the progressive cavity pump  pcp    deviated or crooked holes can be lifted easily with gas lift  this is especially important for offshore platform wells that are usually drilled directionally   gas lift permits the concurrent use of wireline equipment  and such downhole equipment is easily and economically serviced  this feature allows for routine repairs through the tubing   the normal gas lift design leaves the tubing fully open  this permits the use of bhp surveys  sand sounding and bailing  production logging  cutting  paraffin  etc   high formation gors are very helpful for gas lift systems but hinder other artificial lift systems  produced gas means less injection gas is required  whereas  in all other pumping methods  pumped gas reduces volumetric pumping efficiency drastically   gas lift is flexible  a wide range of volumes and lift depths can be achieved with essentially the same well equipment  in some cases  switching to annular flow also can be easily accomplished to handle exceedingly high volumes   a central gas lift system easily can be used to service many wells or operate a

 coincides with the estimated geothermal temperature profile  at each perforation set  the temperature profile shows cooling  which occurs because of the expansion of the produced gas as it passes

depth  this flowmeter was calibrated in a flow loop by measuring its response to a variety of air flows as they were passed through a column of stationary water  a  quot percolation calibration quot  was generated by plotting the diverting flowmeter   s responses to the various air flow rates  with this percolation calibration  the flowmeter   s downhole measurements  shown in the depth track

analysis of the production profile was made from the temperature log by a profiling technique described in the appendix under injection well profiling  at a fixed distance above each perforation set  a tangent line was constructed to the temperature profile at a depth on its recovery toward geothermal  for each tangent  a determination was made of the slope of the tangent and the difference between the profile temperature at the depth of tangency and the corresponding geothermal temperature  by appropriately combining these data  the fractional contributions of the three perforation sets were obtained  as shown by    table       the two analyses are in good agreement    file vol  page      image      png    table        the fractional contributions of the three sets also were determined by a linear analysis of both the diverting flowmeter log and the continuous spinner flowmeter log  with this approach  a perforation set   s fractional contribution to production is determined as the ratio of the change of the flowmeter   s response across the perforation set to the total change of response from below the bottom perforation set to above the top set  the linear analyses of the two flowmeter logs both erroneously indicate that only one quarter of the total production is from the top set  as opposed to the correct contribution of nearly one half  a linear analysis is appropriate when only one phase is present in the wellbore but not when there are two   in this example  the production profiles based on the temperature log and a proper analysis of the diverting flowmeter log corroborate each other  showing the advantage of more than one log in the suite  also  this example demonstrates that when reliable data are analyzed with an inappropriate

specification verification  performance evaluation of the emulsion treating system  or simply  laboratory testing   invariably  the emulsion to be sampled is under pressure  and special procedures must be used to obtain representative samples  for crude specification testing  it is not important to maintain the integrity of the water droplets  however  the sample location point may be critical  in general  samples should not be withdrawn from the bottom of the pipe or vessel  free water may be present and accumulate at the bottom of the pipe or vessel  affecting the basic sediment and water  bs amp w  reading  neither should the sample be withdrawn from the top of the vessel because it primarily will be oil  the best position in the pipe to take an emulsion sample is on the side  preferably with a quill  turbulence and high fluid velocity in the pipe may also ensure that the sample is homogenous and representative   emulsion samples should be representative of the liquid from which they are taken  so emulsification should not be allowed to occur when the sample is extracted  this is especially true of liquids under pressure  for example  for samples obtained at the wellhead  manifold  or oil and gas separator  emulsification can occur because of the turbulence created while the sample is removed from the pressure zone to the sample container  although such a sample might show a high percentage of emulsion  the oil and water in the system actually might not be emulsified      sampling procedure for pressurized sources     a special procedure is used to obtain representative samples from pressurized sources without further emulsification of the liquids     fig       shows a floating piston cylinder used in the procedure  the cylinder is first evacuated and filled with a pressurizing fluid  for example  glycol or a synthetic oil  on one side of the floating piston  the top of the cylinder  evacuated side  is then connected to the sampling location from which the sample is to be taken  the bottom valve on the cylinder is closed and the top valve slowly opened to pressurize the fluid in the cylinder  this is usually a small amount because of the low compressibility of the liquid in the cylinder  once the top valve is completely open  the bottom valve is opened very slowly to drain the pressurizing liquid while allowing the sample liquid to be taken in from the top into the cylinder  the procedure should be performed slowly to obtain the sample without a pressure drop between the cylinder and the sampling location  another variation of the method is to charge the sample into a simple cylinder  without a floating piston  filled with water or mercury  once the sample is captured  the cylinder can be depressurized extremely slowly with little effect on the sample  in situations in which this procedure is not possible  the best sampling method is to bleed the sample line very slowly into the sample container  the idea is to minimize shear and reduce emulsification that may be caused by the sampling procedures    file vol  page     image      png    fig        sampling of a high pressure emulsion          pressure zone samples     samples from a pressure zone can be taken without further emulsification of the liquids if the velocity of the discharging liquid is controlled  one method is to use a piece of small diameter tubing that is    to    ft long  one end of the tubing is connected to a bleeder valve on the line or vessel from which the sample is to be extracted  and the other end is connected to the sample container  the bleeder valve is opened fully  and the sample is allowed to flow through the small diameter tubing into the container  emulsification caused by pressure differential may be largely eliminated by flow through small diameter tubing  however  contact with the tubing walls might produce coalescence  or perturbations to the flow caused by the passage of solids or large water drops might produce emulsification      sample container     another method for withdrawing representative emulsion samples is to use a sample container that initially is filled with water and is equipped with valves at the top and bottom  with the top valve connected to the point from which the sample is to be extracted  the top valve of the container is opened first  and the container is pressured from the line  the valve at the bottom of the container then is opened  and the water is discharged into the atmosphere as the sample enters the container  no emulsification will occur in the container because there is no pressure drop between the source and sample container to cause turbulence  after the sample has been taken  pressure can be bled off through a third valve with little

the produced water must be separated from the oil to meet crude specifications produced water may be produced as  quot free quot  water  i e   water that will settle out fairly rapidly   and it may be produced in the form of an emulsion  a regular oilfield emulsion is a dispersion of water droplets in oil  emulsions can be difficult to treat and may cause several operational problems in wet crude handling facilities and gas oil separating plants  emulsions can create high pressure drops in flow lines  lead to an increase in demulsifier use  and sometimes cause trips or upsets in wet crude handling facilities  the problem is usually at its worst during the winter because of lower surface temperatures  these emulsions must be treated to remove the dispersed water and associated inorganic salts to meet crude specifications for transportation  storage  and export and to reduce corrosion and catalyst poisoning in downstream processing facilities emulsions occur in almost all phases of oil production and processing  inside reservoirs  wellbores  and wellheads  at wet crude handling facilities and gas oil separation plants  and during transportation through pipelines  crude storage  and petroleum processing  the chapter on emulsion treating in the facilities section of this handbook deals with the hardware of emulsion treating equipment  this chapter is limited to the produced oilfield emulsions at the wellhead and in the wet crude handling facilities  the primary focus is on the fundamentals and the application of available technologies in resolving emulsions  the chapter looks at the characteristics  occurrence  formation  stability  handling  and breaking of produced oilfield emulsions  there are several good general references available for more detailed and diversified discussions on crude oil emulsions  a comprehensive presentation and further basic information can be found in an encyclopedia of emulsion technology ___ becher   s classic book_ on the subject  and recent books on petroleum emulsions __this chapter covers four aspects of produced oilfield emulsions   cd edition includes video         sec          provides a brief introduction to the occurrence  types  and characteristics of emulsions  it deals with the fundamental nature of emulsions including their definitions  how they form  and their physical properties  it also includes a subsection on viscosities of emulsions      sec          discusses the stability of emulsions including the formation of films or  quot skins quot  on the droplets  factors that affect emulsion stability include heavy polar material in the oil  asphaltenes  waxes   very fine solids  temperature  droplet size  ph  and brine composition  this section also discusses how to measure emulsion stability      sec          visits the mechanisms of demulsification  the factors that destabilize emulsions include temperature  shear  removal of solids  and control of emulsifying agents  this section also discusses the practical aspects of demulsification and highlights methods of emulsion breaking including thermal  mechanical  electrical  and chemical      sec          discusses field applications and special topics that should be useful for the practicing engineer dealing with emulsions  either regularly or on a limited basis  a method to sample oilfield emulsions is included  a field emulsion treatment program is discussed and  more importantly  methods to prevent emulsion problems are highlighted  finally  the practical aspects of demulsifier selection and optimization are included         definition      an emulsion is a dispersion  droplets  of one liquid in another immiscible liquid  the phase that is present in the form of droplets is the dispersed or internal phase  and the phase in which the droplets are suspended is called the continuous or external phase  for produced oilfield emulsions  one of the liquids is aqueous and the other is crude oil  the amount of water that emulsifies with crude oil varies widely from facility to facility  it can be less than    and sometimes greater than           types of emulsions      produced oilfield emulsions can be classified into three broad groups  water in oil  oil in water  and multiple or complex emulsions  water in oil emulsions consist of water droplets in a continuous oil phase  and oil in water

the physical project work with all members becoming involved in the engineering  purchasing  and contracting effort  these accomplishments must be measured and reported to determine the efficiency of the work and the true financial impact of the project      progress     real progress on a job is determined by a counting of such things as the number of documents delivered vs  the total number or the number of welds made vs  the total number required  progress is not measured by comparing the money spent vs  the money allocated  the requirement for real progress monitoring increases as the job grows in size and complexity  how to account for and measure real progress is a topic not discussed here because of its complexity and the cost of accomplishing it  but your engineering contractor can

some misconceptions about what can be determined with these logs  and the requisite skills to obtain good results  also included are discussions of practical matters such as required safety and environmental tips  sinker bar weight  maximum tool length to pass through a bend  depth control  pricing  and record keeping  attached as an appendix is a set of tables prepared for readers that are consulting this text to find out quickly what type of production logging tools are appropriate to a particular problem  these tables indicate what tools to use  how to use them  and what results  resolution  to expect  these tables were designed to be independent of the general discussion and can be used by themselves  the indexing scheme used in the tabulation is explained in the appendix production logging tools find many applications from the time a well is drilled until abandonment and  occasionally  beyond polaris production optimization log and reservoir information solutions        houston  baker hughes brochure   an appropriate categorization of production logs is by usage  this approach leads to the five distinct categories listed below that also represent a rough chronological order of tool evolution  effective interpretation of the data from each type of log requires significant education and experience    diagnose production problems and allocate production   monitor cement placement   monitor corrosion   monitor reservoir fluid contacts   select zones for recompletion     these are discussed as categories below       category one      includes tools used to track movement of fluid either inside or immediately outside the casing of a well  the logs frequently used for such flow diagnosis and allocation include temperature surveys  mechanical flowmeter surveys  and borehole fluid density or fluid capacitance surveys  each of these tools responds to fluid velocity or fluid type  the logs are run to determine if a production problem  such as excessive water or gas production  is the result of a completion problem or a reservoir problem  their value thus resides in the guidance they give for continued expenditure on a well that is performing poorly  this type of application is largely responsible for the growth and evolution of modern production logging  also belonging in category one are evaluations of the placement of acids or hydraulic fracturing material and diagnoses of premature flow or lost circulation in a drilling well       category two      there are two different objectives of cement placement monitoring  to determine where the cement went  cement top  and to determine whether the cement provides zonal isolation  the logs used to locate the cement top include the temperature log  which responds to hydration heating  the unfocused gamma ray log  which responds to behind pipe density  and the regular bond log  which measures the acoustical deadening of pipe       category three      zonal isolation should be addressed when pressure imbalance causes crossflow through poorly cemented sections  leading to excessive production of unwanted fluids  the tools most often used for this purpose include cement bond logs  temperature  noise  radioactive tracer  and neutron activation logs  the temperature log detects alterations caused by flow  the noise log measures turbulent sound caused by flow  and the tracer log tracks tagged fluid behind casing  the neutron activation log creates tracer in behind pipe water corrosion monitoring tools are specialized in nature and include mechanical caliper tools and electromagnetic casing inspection tools  the mechanical caliper tools are used to assess corrosion internal to the casing and to measure the shape of casing as well as the amount of rod and drillpipe wear inside tubing or casing  the electromagnetic devices respond to changes in metal thickness either inside or outside the pipe containing the tool  these logging tools are either of the eddy current type or of the flux leakage type  or a combination of the two  the eddy current devices measure the load on a coil resulting from eddy currents induced into the wall of the casing  this load increases with increases in wall thickness  the driven frequency of the coil determines the depth of penetration of the field into the casing wall  the flux leakage devices measure  by means of pad conveyed coils in contact with the pipe wall  the induced currents that result from magnetic field lines that escape at abrupt changes in metal wall thickness  both types of tools make indirect measurements that are then related to metal loss through calibration       categories four and five      the last two categories  monitoring of fluid contacts in formations and selection of recompletion zones  use the cased hole nuclear logs such as the neutron  the pulsed neutron  and the various spectral logs  please refer to the

because of the u tube balancing of produced fluid pressures with the hydraulic fluid pressure  gas lift is somewhat depth limited  primarily from compressor pressures required  but has a wide range of production capacity  beam pump produces more from shallower depths and less from deeper depths because of increasing rod weight and stretch as depth increases  electric submersible pumps  esps  are depth limited because of burst limitations on housings and energy considerations for long cables  but can produce large production rates  plunger lift is for low liquid rates  although some wells can produce more than     b d  plunger lift is not particularly depth limited because of the increased energy storage in the casing annulus as depth increases  along with advantage disadvantage lists  the

recovery  often  sufficient pressure volume temperature  pvt  experimental data is not available  and mathematical models that are  quot tuned quot  to experimental data are needed  equation of state  eos  calculations are used for this purpose  eos models are typically easy to implement in a numerical simulator      pressure temperature diagrams     the phase behavior of a typical pure fluid can be represented on a pressure temperature diagram  as illustrated in    fig        from the gibbs phase rule  the number of degrees of freedom are       n    p    which means that one  two  or three phases can be present at equilibrium  for simplicity  these phases are shown as a solid  liquid  and a vapor  although numerous additional solid and liquid phases are possible  as long as no more than three of those phases coexist at equilibrium at the same temperature and pressure  water  for example  has nine different solid phases  each of which has a different crystalline structure walas  s m        phase equilibria in chemical engineering       boston  massachusetts  butterworth publishings  at the pressure and temperature of the earth   s surface  however  we experience only one solid  liquid  and vapor phase of water    file vol  page     image      png    fig        illustration of a pressure temperature diagram for a pure fluid  the path indicated from point a  a vapor  to point b  a liquid  would never encounter an interface       according to the gibbs phase rule  there are no degrees of freedom when three phases are in equilibrium  this necessarily implies that three phases must be in equilibrium only at one temperature and pressure  this is the triple point indicated in    fig        that is  we are not free to choose the temperature and pressure at which three phases can coexist  the temperature and pressure of the triple point are determined   for two phases  however  the degrees of freedom are one  and we can set either the temperature or the pressure  but not both  once the temperature is specified  the pressure is determined  thus  two equilibrium phases are represented by curves on a pressure temperature diagram    the sublimation curve gives the locus of points where solid and vapor are in equilibrium   the melting or fusion curve gives the locus of points where solid and liquid are in equilibrium  the vaporization or saturation curve gives the locus of points where the liquid and vapor are in equilibrium   the pressure along the vaporization curve is called the vapor or saturation pressure  for example  the pure fluid at temperature   t    in    fig       has a vapor pressure of rtenotitle   a single solid  liquid  or vapor phase can exist over a range of temperatures and pressures  degrees of freedom are two   this is indicated in    fig       by the three single phase regions of    solid  liquid  vapor  when the temperature and pressure along the vaporization curve is increased to the critical pressure    p    c    and temperature    t    c    the interface between the liquid and vapor phases becomes indistinct  this occurs at the critical point shown in    fig        beyond the critical point  fluids become  quot supercritical quot  and no phase interface is visible  for example  the vapor at point  quot a quot  in    fig       would become more liquid like as the pressure and temperature are varied along the semicircle to point  quot b  quot  a liquid  the fluid would never exhibit two phases during the process  as identified by an interface  because there is no actual boundary that defines the supercritical region  fluids should be described in terms of liquid like or vapor like   one important characteristic of critical fluids is that thermodynamic properties approach each other  that is  the densities viscosities of the vapor and liquid phases become the same at the critical point  we often inject supercritical fluids  such as carbon dioxide  into reservoirs so that  as the supercritical fluid and the reservoir fluid mix  phase interfaces disappear  facilitating production of hydrocarbon components previously not recovered  thus  an accurate characterization of critical behavior is very important       pvt experiment      a pressure temperature diagram contains no information about molar volume   just phase boundaries  consider an experiment in a closed system that is held at constant temperature  ignoring the solid phase   the experiment is designed to measure pressure as the volume is changed and is generally referred to as a pvt experiment     fig       illustrates several phase behavior states that occur in a pvt experiment  the article on phase diagrams outlines similar experiments for multicomponent mixtures  the steps in the pvt experiment for a

the reality  simulation of petroleum reservoir performance refers to the construction and operation of a model whose behavior assumes the appearance of actual reservoir behavior  the model itself is either physical  for example  a laboratory sandpack  or mathematical  a mathematical model is a set of equations that  subject to certain assumptions  describes the physical processes active in the reservoir  although the model itself obviously lacks the reality of the reservoir  the behavior of a valid model simulates   assumes the appearance of   the actual reservoir the purpose of simulation is estimation of field performance  e g   oil recovery  under one or more producing schemes  whereas the field can be produced only once  at considerable expense  a model can be produced or run many times at low expense over a short period of time  observation of model results that represent different producing conditions aids selection of an optimal set of producing conditions for the reservoir the tools of reservoir simulation range from the intuition and judgment of the engineer to complex mathematical models requiring use of digital computers  the question is not whether to simulate  but rather which tool or method to use  this chapter concerns the numerical mathematical model requiring a digital computer  the reservoir simulation chapter in the      edition of the   petroleum engineering handbook  the merriam webster dictionary  new revised edition        new york city  merriam webster  included a general description of reservoir simulation models  a discussion related to how and why they are used  choice of different types of models for different reservoir problems  and reliability of simulation results in the face of model assumptions and uncertainty in reservoir fluid and rock description parameters  that material is largely omitted here  instead  this chapter attempts to summarize current practices and trends related to development and application of reservoir simulation models models have been referred to by   type    such as   black oil      compositional      thermal      generalized    or   impes      implicit      sequential      adaptive

pressure      gas pressure at depth     prediction of injection gas pressure at depth is essential for proper gas lift installation design and for analyzing or troubleshooting gas lift operations  most gas pressure at depth calculations are based on a static gas column  pressure loss  because of friction from the flow of injection gas through a typical casing tubing annulus  is negligible  the gas velocity in the annulus is considered negligible because the cross sectional area of the annulus is so much larger than the port area of a gas lift valve  the maximum gas flow rate is limited by

average pressure and temperature  the solution to this equation requires several iterations  generally  the average pressure and temperature are assumed to be the arithmetic mean of the wellhead and

cuttings from the bit up the annulus to the surface  if the cuttings cannot be removed from the wellbore  they will soon impede drilling      overview     in rotary drilling operations  both the fluid and the rock fragments are moving in the annulus  the situation is complicated by the fact that the fluid velocity varies from zero at the wall to a maximum at a point between the pipe outer wall and the wellbore wall  in addition  the rotation of the drillpipe imparts centrifugal force on the rock fragments  which affects their relative location in the annulus  because of the extreme complexity of this flow behavior  drilling personnel have relied primarily on observation and experience for determining the lifting ability of the drilling fluids  in practice  either the flow rate or effective viscosity of the fluid is increased  if problems related to inefficient cuttings removal are encountered  the result is a natural tendency toward thick muds and high annular velocities  however  increasing the mud viscosity or flow rate can be detrimental to the cleaning action beneath the bit  and cause a reduction in the penetration rate  there may be a considerable economic penalty associated with the use of a higher flow rate or mud viscosity than necessary  increasing the mud viscosity will not necessarily improve the cuttings transport efficiency in directional and horizontal sections as well  usually  transport is usually not a problem  if the well is near vertical  however  considerable difficulties can occur when the well is being drilled directionally  because cuttings may accumulate either as a stationary bed at hole angles above about      or in a moving  churning bed at lower hole angles  drilling problems that may result include    stuck pipe  lost circulation

conditions  examples include phase separation  pumping  and compression  sometimes the design specifications for downhole processes may be looser than surface processing because control is more difficult  partial processing  in which fluids are separated into a relatively pure phase stream and a residual mixed phase stream  are most common  with these technologies  the following are possible    gas liquid separation  oil water separation  water injection and disposal  gas injection  downhole separation technology is best suited for removing the bulk     to      of the gas or water  with downstream surface or subsea equipment being used to    polish    the streams for complete separation  in the case of gas separation  even with complete separation downhole  dissolved gas will evolve from the liquid phase as the pressure drops when the oil flows to surface  because of this dissolved gas  it is not possible to obtain a pure liquid phase at the surface  in addition  some gas in the liquid phase is often desirable  to help lift the liquid up the tubing      historical perspective     a conventional development normally involves many wells feeding through flowlines to a central processing facility that is designed to separate oil  gas  and water from each other and prepare each stream for sale or reinjection disposal  onshore  or in shallow water  large equipment is preferred because it is more tolerant of upsets  and smaller size and weight have no significant advantage  but most convenient  easily accessible reservoirs have already been discovered and developed  new exploration often focuses on areas farther offshore and in remote areas that are more difficult to develop   drivers for downhole processing include    remote wells  cost of deepwater production structures  long distance or subsea pipeline costs  chemical costs for water handling  corrosion  environmental concerns  capital and operating costs can be reduced by taking advantage of existing facilities and bringing smaller    satellite    fields into that existing infrastructure  but that infrastructure may have processing limits that require some upstream  i e   downhole  separation and disposal of either gas or water to allow oil to enter the facility  in new developments  partial processing downhole may reduce the size and weight required for surface equipment  emulsion and corrosion chemical costs are often determined by the amount of water production and may be reduced if water is removed downhole within the well itself  emissions of greenhouse gases may be reduced by downhole processing as an alternative to flaring or venting produced gas   use of downhole equipment has been driven by the hydraulics and production requirements of individual wells rather than by the overall development plan  examples of this are the various forms of artificial lift  esps  rod pumps  progressive cavity pumps  pcp   jet pumps  and even gas lift  prior to       no downhole processing was performed except that related to conventional artificial lift of wells  since then  new downhole separation technology has been conceived  with field installations and tests following  as described hereafter  even now  application of the technology is sparse and would still be characterized as proving the technology rather than routine application  as is the case with most new technology development  many of the field tests were done with wells that were already so marginal that there was little to lose  by       there were approximately    downhole water separation injection installations and approximately    downhole gas liquid separation installations  increasingly  though  downhole processing is gaining wider use and is being considered as part of overall field development strategy      reasons to use downhole processing     the reasons for downhole processing are as diverse as the challenges facing a new or mature oil or gas field  it can provide a supplement alternative to surface processing or improve well hydraulics  existing surface facilities may have limited capacity and require some form of debottlenecking  they may have high water handling costs  such as chemicals  gas can be separated and reinjected downhole  debottlenecking surface reinjection compressors  downhole processing may reduce the size and weight of surface facilities  which is desirable for offshore and remote areas  remote wells may be drilled far from existing production facilities  requiring transportation of fluids at significant operational and capital cost  surface transportation and processing of produced fluids incurs greater environmental risks of spills or emissions  to increase well production  water can be separated and reinjected downhole to unload gas wells and improve hydraulics  gas may also be separated from oil streams downhole to improve tubing hydraulics at very high gas fract

quantities  chemicals are added to the water to aid in fracturing and prevent damage to the reservoir  and normally less than   percent of the fluid contents are chemical compounds  because fracturing involves a large amount of water  innovations to reuse recycle and safely dispose of the water are an important part of environmental stewardship      mechanism     hydraulic fracturing is the process of pumping fluid into a wellbore at an injection rate too high for the formation to accept without breaking boschee  p        handling produced water from hydraulic fracturing  oil and gas facilities                 during injection  the formation   s resistance to flow increases  and the pressure in the wellbore increases to a value called the break down pressure  which is the sum of the in situ compressive stress and the strength of the formation  when the formation    breaks down     a fracture is formed  and the injected fluid flows through it   fluid not containing any solid  called the    pad     is injected first  until the fracture is wide enough to accept a propping agent  the purpose of the propping agent is to keep apart the fracture surfaces once the pumping operation ceases  the pressure in the fracture decreases bellow the compressive in situ stress trying to close the fracture  in deep reservoirs  man made ceramic beads are used to hold open or    prop    the fracture  in shallow reservoirs  sand is normally used as the propping agent      chemical additives     water comprises    percent of typical fracking fluid  followed by     percent sand and     percent other chemical additives  the chemicals serve multiple functions  including limiting the growth of bacteria and preventing corrosion of the well casing  fracfocus        chemical use in hydraulic fracturing   the conditions of the well being fractured determine the number of chemical additives used  typically  very low concentrations of between three and    additive chemicals will be used  depending on the characteristics of the water and the formation being fractured  each component serves a specific purpose  for example  the predominant fluids used for fracture treatments in the gas shale plays are water   based fracturing fluids mixed with friction   reducing additives  called slickwater   the addition of friction reducers allows fracturing fluids and proppants  like sand or small ceramic beads  to be pumped to the target zone at a higher rate and reduced pressure than with water alone  other additives include  biocides to prevent microorganism growth and reduce biofouling of the fractures  oxygen scavengers and other stabilizers to prevent corrosion of metal pipes  and acids to remove drilling mud damage within the near   wellbore area      water sources     large quantities of relatively fresh water are essential in hydraulic fracturing  water quality is a key factor in fracturing because impurities can reduce the efficiency of the additives used in the process  most water used in hydraulic fracturing comes from surface water sources like lakes  rivers  aquifers  and municipal supplies  which may have to be hauled over long distances lord  p   weston  m

pressure relief  blowdown  and distance piece venting and draining __toc__     overview     compressors used in the oil and gas industry are divided into six groups according to their intended service  these are flash gas compressors  gas lift compressors  reinjection compressors  booster compressors  vapor recovery compressors  and casinghead compressors      flash gas compressors       flash gas compressors are used in oil handling facilities to compress gas that is  quot flashed quot  from a hydrocarbon liquid when the liquid flows from a higher pressure to a lower pressure separator  flash gas compressors typically handle low flow rates and produce high compression ratios      gas lift compressors       gas lift compressors are frequently used in oil handling facilities where compression of formation gases and gas lift gas is required  gas lift compressor duty is frequently of low to medium throughput with high compression ratios  many gas lift compressors are installed on offshore facilities      reinjection compressors       the reinjection of natural gas is employed to increase or to maintain oil production  reinjection compressors can be required to deliver gas at discharge pressures in excess of        psi  reinjection compressors also are used for underground storage of natural gas  compressors  applied to these services  have large compression ratios  high power requirements  and low volume flow rates      booster compressors       gas transmission through pipelines results in pressure drop because of friction losses  booster compressors are used to restore the pressure drop from these losses  selection of these compressors involves evaluating the economic trade off of distance between pipeline boosting stations and life cycle cost of each compressor station  booster compressors also are used in fields that are experiencing pressure decline  most centrifugal pipeline booster compressors are gas turbine driven  although the use of variable speed motor drives is becoming more prevalent  low speed integral gas engine reciprocating compressors also are used for gas transmission applications  booster compressors typically are designed for high throughput rates and low compression ratio  many booster applications can be configured in a single stage centrifugal compressor      vapor recovery compressors       vapor recovery compressors are used to gather gas from tanks and other low pressure equipment in the facility  often the gas from a vapor recovery compressor is routed to a flash gas  gas lift  or booster compressor for further compression  low suction pressures  high compression ratios  and low gas throughput rates characterize these compressors      casinghead compressors       casinghead compressors are usually used with electric submersible pumps and rod pumps where formation gas is required to be separated downhole and then transported through the annulus  often the compressor discharge is routed to either a booster or flash gas compressor or to a low pressure gathering system  like vapor recovery compressors  casinghead compressors operate with low suction pressures  high compression ratios  and low gas throughput rates      classification and types     compressors are classified into two major categories   positive displacement and dynamic  kinetic  compressors  positive displacement compressors are further divided into reciprocating and rotary types  reciprocating compressors are positive displacement machines in which the compressing and displacing element is a piston having a

reservoir rocks are discussed in this article  there are three aspects to this displacement  gas and oil viscosities  gas oil capillary pressure    p    c    and relative permeability    k    r    data  and the compositional interaction  or component mass transfer  between the oil and gas phases      gas oil viscosity and density contrast     one must first understand the viscosity and density differences between gas and oil to appreciate why the gas oil displacement process can be very inefficient  gases at reservoir conditions have viscosities of         cp  whereas oil viscosities generally range from     cp to tens of centipoises  gases at reservoir conditions have densities generally one third or less than that of oil  thus  gas is generally one to two orders of magnitude less viscous than the oil it is trying to displace  regarding the fluid density difference  gas is always considerably  quot lighter quot  than the oil  hence  gas  when flowing  will segregate by gravity to the top of the reservoir or zone and oil will  quot sink quot  simultaneously to the bottom of the reservoir or zone   another gas oil property that must be known for calculations at reservoir conditions is the interfacial tension  ift  between the oil and gas fluid pair  this value is needed at reservoir conditions for the conversion of gas oil capillary pressure data from surface to reservoir conditions  a number of technical papers discuss the calculation of ift from compositional information about the oil and gas phases katz  d l   monroe  r r   and tanner  r p

gas oil capillary pressure and relative permeability data are typically measured by commercial laboratories using routine special core analysis procedures  gas oil capillary pressure data can be measured with either porous plate or centrifuge equipment  one approach for obtaining gas oil relative permeability data is the viscous displacement method in which gas displaces oil  a second method is the centrifuge method  which is generally used to obtain capillary pressure and relative permeability information simultaneously   in all cases  gas is the nonwetting phase in this displacement  hence  it will preferentially flow through the largest pores first  however  what is very important in the determination of the oil relative permeability is the distribution of the oil phase in the core sample because in real reservoirs connate water occupies the smallest pores  as shown by hagoort hagoort  j    quot oil recovery by gravity drainage  quot  spej  june            initial water saturation has a significant effect on oil relative permeability during the gas oil displacement  centrifuge experiments   the water phase will occupy a greater percentage of the smaller pore spaces as the connate water saturation increases  as a result  the pore structure appears more streamlined to the oil and gas phases  the oil relative permeability at higher connate water saturations is considerably higher  see    fig       and the discussion of capillary pressure and relative permeability concepts in relative permeability and capillary pressure     file vol  page      image      png

wells drilled with oil base mud  j pet technol                 spe        g   was originally developed to measure formation resistivities in boreholes containing oil based muds and in air drilled boreholes because electrode devices could not work in these nonconductive boreholes  however  because the tools were easy to run and required much less in the way of chart corrections than laterals or normals  induction tools were used in a wide range of borehole salinity soon after their introduction      principles     commercial induction tools consist of multiple coil arrays designed to optimize vertical resolution and depth of investigation  however  to illustrate induction tool fundamentals  it is instructive to first examine the basic building block of multiple coil arrays  the two coil sonde      fig       shows that a two coil sonde consists of a transmitter and receiver mounted coaxially on a mandrel  typical coil separations range from   to    ft apart  in practice  each coil can consist of from several to     or more turns  with the exact number of turns determined by engineering considerations  the operating frequency of commercial induction tools is in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz range  with    khz being the most commonly used frequency before         file vol  page      image      png    fig        schematic representation of a two coil induction array showing the distribution of the currents induced in the formation by the transmitter coil       the induction transmitter coil is driven by an alternating current that creates a primary magnetic field around the transmitter coil  the primary magnetic field causes eddy currents to flow in a continuous circular distribution  often mistakenly called  quot ground loops quot   centered around the borehole axis  the color contours in    fig       show the current distribution  these eddy currents are proportional to the formation conductivity  and they in turn generate a secondary magnetic field  which induces an alternating voltage in the receiver coil  this receiver voltage is first order proportional to the conductivity of the formation moran  j h  and kunz  k s        basic theory of induction logging and application to study of two coil sondes  geophysics                    because the transmitter current is alternating  there is a phase shift between the transmitter current and the current density in the formation  this phase shift is not the same in all parts of the formation   it increases with distance into the formation     fig         similarly  the phase in the receiver is even further shifted  at very low conductivities  the total phase shift is approximately       and increases with increasing formation conductivity  induction tools have always measured the part of the voltage that is exactly       phase shifted from the transmitter current  called the r signal   as the conductivity increased  and the phase shifted  the voltage was a bit less than expected from a linear relationship  this difference is called skin effect  modern induction tools make an additional measurement at a phase shift of       from the transmitter current  called the x signal   these two measurements  being in quadrature  allow precise phase and amplitude measurement of the receiver voltage      induction response     to produce adequate sensitivity to the uninvaded zone  induction tools perforce include signals from a large volume of formation  the challenge is to determine exactly where the measurement is coming from in the formation  doll defined the geometrical factor as a  d function   g            z     which defines the part of the total signal that comes from an infinitesimally thin loop around the borehole  this definition is valid only at very low conductivities  moran defined a modification of the geometrical factor that is valid in low contrast formations at any conductivity  this response is known as the born response anderson  b  and barber  t        induction logging  houston  texas  schlumberger   the response to formation layers is given by the vertical response function   g    v     z     which is defined as the integral of the  d response function   g            z    over radius         the response to radial variations in a thick bed is given by the radial response function   g    r            which is defined as the integral of   g            z    over   z    the response of the array to invasion in a thick bed is characterized by the integrated radial response   g    r    which is the cumulative integral of

the single component of the well construction process that remains in contact with the wellbore throughout the entire drilling operation  drilling fluid systems are designed and formulated to perform efficiently under expected wellbore conditions  advances in drilling fluid technology have made it possible to implement a cost effective  fit for purpose system for each interval in the well construction process the active drilling fluid system comprises a volume of fluid that is pumped with specially designed mud pumps from the surface pits  through the drillstring exiting at the bit  up the annular space in the wellbore  and back to the surface for solids removal and maintenance treatments as needed  the capacity of the surface system usually is determined by the rig size  and rig selection is determined by the well design  for example  the active drilling fluid volume on a deepwater well might be several thousand barrels  much of that volume is required to fill the long drilling riser that connects the rig floor to the seafloor  by contrast  a shallow well on land might only require a few hundred barrels of fluid to reach its objective a properly designed and maintained drilling fluid performs several essential functions during well construction    cleans the hole by transporting drilled cuttings to the surface  where they can be mechanically removed from the fluid before it is recirculated downhole   balances or overcomes formation pressures in the wellbore to minimize the risk of well control issues   supports and stabilizes the walls of the wellbore until casing can be set and cemented or openhole completion equipment can be installed   prevents or minimizes damage to the producing formation s    cools and lubricates the drillstring and bit   transmits hydraulic horsepower to the bit   allows information about the producing formation s  to be retrieved through cuttings analysis  logging while drilling data  and wireline logs   the cost of the drilling fluid averages     of the total tangible costs of well construction  however  drilling fluid performance can affect overall well construction costs in several ways  a correctly formulated and well maintained drilling system can contribute to cost containment throughout the drilling operation by enhancing the rate of penetration  rop   protecting the reservoir from unnecessary damage  minimizing the potential for loss of circulation  stabilizing the wellbore during static intervals  and helping the operator remain in compliance with environmental and safety regulations  many drilling fluid systems can be reused from well to well  thereby reducing waste volumes and costs incurred for building new mud to the extent possible  the drilling fluid system should help preserve the productive potential of the hydrocarbon bearing zone s   minimizing fluid and solids invasion into the zones of interest is critical to achieving desired productivity rates  the drilling fluid also should comply with established health  safety  and environmental  hse  requirements so that personnel are not endangered and environmentally sensitive areas are protected from contamination  drilling fluid companies work closely with oil and gas operating companies to attain these mutual goals  __toc__     basic functions of a drilling fluid         transport cuttings to surface      transporting drilled cuttings to surface is the most basic function of drilling fluid  to accomplish this  the fluid should have adequate suspension properties to help ensure that cuttings and commercially added solids such as barite weighing material do not settle during static intervals  the fluid should have the correct chemical properties to help prevent or minimize the dispersion of drilled solids  so that these can be removed efficiently at the surface  otherwise  these solids can disintegrate into ultrafine particles that can damage the producing zone and impede drilling efficiency       prevent well control issues      the column of drilling fluid in the well exerts hydrostatic pressure on the wellbore  under normal drilling conditions  this pressure should balance or exceed the natural formation pressure to help prevent an influx of gas or other formation fluids  as the formation pressures increase  the density of the drilling fluid is increased to help maintain a safe margin and prevent  quot kicks quot  or  quot blowouts quot   however  if the density of the fluid becomes too heavy  the formation can break down  if drilling fluid is lost in the resultant fractures  a reduction of hydrostatic pressure occurs  this pressure reduction also can lead to an influx from a pressured formation  therefore  maintaining the appropriate fluid density for the wellbore pressure regime is critical to safety and wellbore stability       preserve wellbore stability      maintaining the optimal drilling flui

the technologies that have been developed over the past     years to evaluate  design  operate  and monitor such projects  use of water to increase oil production is known as  quot secondary recovery quot  and typically follows  quot primary production  quot  which uses the reservoir   s natural energy  fluid and rock expansion  solution gas drive  gravity drainage  and aquifer influx  to produce oil the principal reason for waterflooding an oil reservoir is to increase the oil production rate and  ultimately  the oil recovery  this is accomplished by  quot voidage replacement quot    injection of water to increase the reservoir pressure to its initial level and maintain it near that pressure  the water displaces oil from the pore spaces  but the efficiency of such displacement depends on many factors  e g   oil viscosity and rock characteristics   in oil fields such as wilmington  california  u s a   and ekofisk  north sea   voidage replacement also has been used to mitigate additional surface subsidence  in these cases  the high porosity of the unconsolidated sandstones of the wilmington oil field   s reservoirs and of the soft chalk reservoir rock in the

declined  the water production rate often would increase  this water typically was disposed of by dumping it into nearby streams or rivers  in the     s  the practice began of reinjecting the produced water into porous and permeable subsurface formations  including the reservoir interval from which the oil and water originally had come  by the     s  reinjection of produced water had become a

production  also  in the u s   thousands of wells had been drilled that were closely spaced  so that the effects of water injection were more obvious and so were more quickly understandable in addition to the need to dispose of saline water that was produced along with the oil  several other factors made waterflooding a logical and economical method for increasing recovery from oil fields  very early on  it was recognized that in most reservoirs  only a small percentage of the original oil in place  ooip  was being recovered during the primary production period because of depletion of

life and efficiency      bearing systems     roller cone bearing systems are designed to be in satisfactory operating condition when the cutting structure of the bit is worn out  to achieve this standard of bearing performance  modern goals for seal and bearing system life are   million or more revolutions of a bit without failure  as opposed to            or fewer in the recent past  to achieve this goal  research into bearing  seal  and lubricant designs and into materials that improve seal and bearing life is ongoing   roller cone bits primarily use two types of bearings  roller bearings and journal bearings  sometimes called friction bearings  each type is normally composed of a number of separate components  including    primary bearings  secondary bearings  seal system

     primary bearings are as large as possible within the limits of available space  secondary bearings are smaller  reduced diameter bearings located adjacent to the interior apex area in a cone  secondary bearings provide supplemental load bearing capability  primary and secondary bearings can individually be either roller bearings or journal bearings  it is not uncommon for a bearing system to be made up of combinations of the two   seals prevent cuttings and drilling fluids from entering the bearing system and prevent lubricant from escaping the bearing system  thrust washers are located on the end of leg journals and between the primary and secondary bearing surfaces to resist axial loading   most roller cone bits incorporate what appears to be a ball type bearing  this is the cone retention feature  the balls prevent cones from separating from their journals  finally  the lubrication system contains the lubricant that  throughout the life of the bearing system  provides lubrication to bearings and seals  these features are described below       roller bearing systems      roller bearings are a common bit bearing system because they can reliably support large loads and generally perform well in the drilling environment     fig         they are typically used on larger diameter bits   gt     in    which have more physical space to accommodate the rollers

journal bearings are extremely efficient     fig       compares roller bearing and journal bearing assemblies    file devol      final page     image      png    fig      comparison of journal  and

very close to the target itself  not just for correlating seismic data to the well but also using those wells for the collection of novel geophysical data from below the noisy surface or weathered zone  new techniques for acquisition of seismic data from wellbores are available  and should become routine tools in the arsenal of the reservoir geophysicist      single well techniques     single well techniques involve placing seismic sources and receivers in the same well and include    sonic logging  single well imaging      sonic logging      sonic logging has become routine  and the collection of compressional and shear velocities in fast and slow formations is more or less straightforward  particularly with the use of dipole sonic tools and waveform processing  the application of modified sonic logging tools for imaging near the wellbore is not routine but has been demonstrated in several cases  research and development continues in this area   modern sonic logging tools can provide a good measure of compressional and shear velocities  values that are required for calibrating seismic data at wells and for the investigation of lithology and fluid content from seismic data  of course  the interpreter must be careful to know if the data represent invaded or uninvaded conditions and make appropriate corrections if necessary  modern sonic logging tools can often provide reliable values for velocities through casing  often  the most reliable sonic logs in soft shales can only be found behind casing because of the inability to log openhole the depth intervals in which shales are flowing or collapsing   compressional sonic log values are used in reservoir geophysics to tie well depths to seismic two way travel time  first the sonic transit time is integrated to obtain a depth calibrated time scale  then synthetic seismograms are created through determination of reflection coefficients  including the density log  and convolution with a known or assumed wavelet  this synthetic seismogram is often adjusted to account for    borehole effects  absence of data in the shallowest section  other unspecified effects  including velocity dispersion caused by thin bed layering below seismic resolution  the shear sonic log values are then added to create synthetic seismograms that demonstrate avo behavior for comparison with the prestack data near the well  often  additional work is conducted to model the changes in seismic response when rocks of slightly different lithology or fluid saturation are encountered away from the well  both the

forced to drill deeper to find new reserves  much of the higher cost of drilling deeper  especially onshore  is typically associated with decreased rate of penetration  rop  caused by both harder rock and higher mud weights required to counter the overpressured reservoirs often associated with deeper drilling  the following discussion centers on technologies intended to enhance the deep drilling capability      mud hammers     industrial hammers for hard rock drilling have been around for some time  but most have been air operated and used in the mining industry  historically  hammers have been thought to have limited capability in oil and gas drilling operations  with their use limited to air drilling  because of    chip holddown    and erosion through the hammer when drilling mud is used  hammers were not considered for drilling operations involving drilling mud  as a result  hammers have never been seriously considered for most deep drilling where hammer energy might enhance rop by helping to overcome increased rock strength   in an effort to develop novel drilling technologies  the us department of energy  doe  awarded a contract to novatek to develop an    integrated    drilling system using a mud hammer as the primary engine  see    fig         the previously referenced high speed communication system for drillpipe was part of that development  another part of that development was a mud hammer that incorporated a number of revolutionary concepts  as shown in    fig        most notably  the bit was a radical departure from typical hammer bits  it was essentially a five bladed drag bit with polycrystalline diamond cutters  pdcs  specially manufactured by novatek to allow the aggressive drag bit profile to be used in soft formations but still allow enhanced drilling in hard formations using the high energy impacts of the optimized industrial hammer  in addition  the hammer piston is used to energize a series of high pressure jets            psi  that exhaust directly in front of each pdc to achieve an unprecedented level of cleaning ahead of each cutter  the jets also energize fractures ahead of the bit to enhance rop    file devol      final page

ids hammer and other hammers were part of a test program funded by the doe to provide a focused study program for investigation of mud hammer potential in deep hard rock drilling environments  that program is being run by terratek with several industry participants  the first results of that program were published in the spe   journal of petroleum technology online   tibbitts  g a   long  r c   miller  b e  et al        world s first benchmarking of drilling mud hammer performance at depth conditions  presented at the iadc spe drilling conference  dallas  texas        february  spe       ms    in summary  the current status of mud hammer investigation is still unfolding  with improvements in a number of mud hammers being driven by the testing program at terratek  the promise provided by mud hammers is potentially far more extensive than simply enhancing rop in deep hard rock  although that alone would be sufficient  mud hammers provide extremely strong seismic energy coupling into the rock  it might be possible to incorporate a mud hammer based seismic imaging system into the previously discussed high speed communications system to provide a    seismic look ahead    capability that could allow navigation directly into the desired hydrocarbon target or sweet spot  such a system would be a significant step forward in the exploration and development of fractured  unconventional reservoirs      mud pulse drilling     another novel approach to enhancing rop in deep mud drilled wells was developed by tempress technologies     fig       shows the basic principles used in this system  chip holddown is a well documented phenomenon associated with mud drilling  especially in deep environments  in essence  the fluid pressure of the mud inhibits rock chips made by the drill bit from being removed from the cutting face in front of the bit  the result is regrinding of cuttings and a slowing of rop    file devol      final page     image      png    fig      mud

bottomhole measuring points   is there a need to perform continuous or repeated measurements over months or years   what economics apply  and do they imply a possible tradeoff with the quality or quantity of the measurements      surface readout vs  downhole recording     measurements can be transmitted to the surface  usually via an electric cable  or recorded in downhole memory powered by batteries   sro has the obvious advantage of providing data in real time  real time readouts are especially beneficial for transient measurements that require time for the pressure to stabilize and radial flow to develop  because stabilization times depend on reservoir and fluid properties and because the determination of these parameters is often the purpose of pressure measurements in well tests  predicting the duration of stabilization periods is often difficult  sro is preferred in these cases   some applications  usually those in the lower economic tier  can be conducted without the need for sro  the benefits include lower operating costs and a fixed operations schedule  the drawback is the difficulty of guaranteeing the quality of the acquired data  including the potential for significant operating losses if the bottomhole recording equipment malfunctions  for these reasons  downhole recording  dhr  should be chosen only when the measurement target does not necessarily depend on stabilization times or when stabilization times are already known  e g   to measure the average reservoir pressure in a reservoir of known mobility    many industry tools provide both sro and dhr  the measuring section of these tools is common to both options  in the sro option  the sensor electronics are coupled to a telemetry system for uphole transmission  and the cable supplies downhole power  in the dhr option  downhole batteries supply power  and the data are stored in memory boards for future readout or downloading to suitable computer systems      surface shut in vs  downhole shut in     the practice of downhole shut in during a buildup test as opposed to surface shut in is discussed in pressure transient testing  the advantages of downhole shut in include    control of the wellbore volume  afterflow   reduction of the duration of buildup tests  choice on the recording mode  sro or dhr   downhole shut in can be performed during conventional drillstem tests  dst  or during tests performed on production wells  in a dst  the downhole shut in valve is usually the main test valve  shut in is performed at the end of a flow period by actuating the test valve  traditionally buildup pressures are recorded in dhr mode  another procedure is to use the dst valve as the main shut in valve while the datalatch electrical wireline downhole recorder transmitter is used to observe pressures in real time during the buildup  datalatch technology is described later on in this page   in producing wells  downhole shut in is performed by setting a valve assembly in the tubing before performing the test  the tubing must have been previously equipped with locator nipples so that the valve can be anchored at the appropriate depth  the valve is run on either a slickline carrying a dhr pressure gauge or an electric line equipped with an sro recording gauge  the shut in valve is actuated by a sequence of pulls and releases on the slickline or cable  commonly operated shut in valves can perform in the range of up to    open close cycles  after which the valve assembly is released from the setting nipples by an appropriate pull on the line  other versions of shut in valves can be operated by a clock  small explosive squib  or battery      bottomhole conveyance of gauges     pressure an

frequently dictate that reciprocating internal combustion engines be selected to drive energy industry equipment        types of engine combustion     there are three main types of engine combustion   all three types of engine combustion convert the chemical potential energy found in the fuel to mechanical kinetic energy  the combustion cycle and fuel type required to complete this task are what distinguish the three engine types from each other   two stroke cycle engines or two cycle engines complete their combustion cycle in two piston strokes that are accomplished with one revolution of the crankshaft  the two strokes are the power and compression strokes  the two stroke engine is unique because it does not control the release of exhaust or the admission of an air fuel mixture into the cylinder with a traditional valve arrangement  one intake and one exhaust       two stroke cycle      as shown in    fig        the process of filling the cylinder with an air fuel mixture and exhausting the burned gases occurs almost simultaneously near the end of the power stroke  as the piston moves downward during the power stroke  first the exhaust port is uncovered and then the intake port is uncovered  these ports allow the exhaust to escape under its own pressure and then be displaced by the incoming air fuel mixture  because some of the air fuel mixture can be lost in this process  some two stroke engines are equipped with fuel injection systems that raise their fuel efficiency close to that of a four stroke engine  the compression stroke compresses the air fuel mixture that is then ignited by a spark plug  the burning of the air fuel mixture pushes the piston through the power stroke  as the power stroke reaches its end  the cycle begins again    file vol  page     image      png    fig      idealized   p v   diagram for a two cycle engine  numbers signify the beginning of various events in the two stroke cycle  for example    through   are the compression stroke and   back to   is the combustion expansion stroke  exhaust gas is evacuated between   and   when the exhaust port is open and fuel mixture is drawn in between   and   when the intake port is open       lubricating a two stroke engine is also unique compared with other engines because the engine does not have a traditional valve arrangement that separates the crankcase from the combustion chamber  lubrication of the engine is accomplished by an auxiliary lubricator that injects a prescribed amount of oil into critical areas  another method  commonly used on small two stroke engines  is to combine a prescribed amount of oil with the fuel so that it lubricates the engine as the air fuel mixture passes through the crankcase   most two stroke engines are the slow to mid speed variety      to     rpm   primarily because of lubricating concerns and because the crankshaft is turning only once per cycle  some of the largest engines in the world are two stroke engines  as engine size and power increase  the size and weight of the internal components also increase  which limits their ability to reciprocate quickly  therefore  the two stroke engine design works well for large high power engines with its slower speed and fewer strokes  there are two stroke engine models rated well in excess of       brake hp  bhp        four stroke cycle      a four stroke cycle engine is commonly called a four cycle engine  four cycle engines complete their combustion cycle in four strokes of the piston that are accomplished with two revolutions of the crankshaft  as shown in    fig        the

the density of the wellbore fluid      focused gamma ray density logging tool     the focused gamma ray density logging tool incorporates a compacted slug of cesium     at the bottom of an open cage  the cesium emits gamma rays  and a lead lens focuses gamma rays in a narrow beam brllel to the axis of the cage  because the cage is open  wellbore fluid is present inside the cage  and the fluid is in the path of the focused beam  the gamma rays have an energy level low enough that the rays are deflected by the electron cloud surrounding the nucleus of any atom  furthermore  the amount of backscatter  or absorption  is directly related to the density of the electron cloud and  therefore  to the density of the wellbore fluid  those gamma rays that are backscattered or absorbed do not emerge from the wellbore fluid at the top of the cage   at the upper end of the tool cage  a gamma detector responds to the gamma rays that still remain when the beam emerges from the wellbore fluid  a counter determines the counts min  intensity  of the gamma rays  this information is transmitted through the logging cable to the surface      types of gamma ray detectors     the preferred gamma ray detector is a scintillation crystal because of its high sensitivity and short dead time  the interval required between detection of different gamma rays   many tools use geiger tubes as the gamma ray detector  a geiger tube has a much longer dead time than a scintillation crystal  it is necessary to use multiple geiger tubes to ensure detection of all the gamma rays  preferably  there are eight tubes  but tools of lesser quality may have as few as three   count rate is inversely related to the density of the fluid in the wellbore and is recorded in g cm   vs  depth  the count rate density relationship is calibrated first with air in the open cage  yielding a count rate corresponding to a density of   g cm  and then with tap water in the open cage  yielding a count rate corresponding to a density of   g cm   for some tools  there is an aluminum block of known density that can be placed in the open cage  there is enough nonlinearity in the relationship to justify a calibration with three known density values  but typical practice is to use only two  often  the recording system is adjusted so that the range from   to   g cm  spans the right side track of a typical log  with    chart divisions in this track  the recorded log is shown at a sensitivity of      g cm   attempts to increase the recording sensitivity appreciably over that used for the typical display result in a trace with many irregularities because of the statistical nature of nuclear events  the irregularities can make log interpretation difficult   the advantage of the focused tool is that it measures only the density of the wellbore fluid  if an unfocused  gravel pack  tool is used  the gamma rays investigate not only the density of the wellbore fluid  but also that of the pipe wall as well as the material and fluids that are close to the outside wall  the gamma tool can distinguish between the phases in a two phase mixture  but it cannot distinguish among the phases of a three phase mixture      procedure     the tool should be logged downward at logging speeds between    and    ft min in a flowing production well  a constant logging speed should be used  and the same speed should be used for all runs  it is best to log downward from a starting depth above all the perforations  and to log all the way to the deepest depth that can be surveyed  in a slugging or churning multiphase flow  the log may show variable behavior even in intervals that are not perforated  in that case  another logging run is advisable to establish the degree of repeatability  if the result is less than desirable  a stationary measurement can be time averaged for each selected location  usually a logging run is also made with the well shut in  this log should be run after at least two or three hours of shut in  to be sure that the fluid distribution is stable  if the well has been shut in overnight  a shut in log can be recorded  but the well must flow for   or   hours before the first flowing log is recorded  if the tool is centralized  there is a tendency for the recorded density to be somewhat low in a multiphase flow relative to the average density across the wellbore cross section  this is because the lighter phase tends to rise through the center of the cross section  leaving the remainder of the cross section for the heavier phase       hazards      although the health  safety  and environmental risks are generally low  radiation safety procedures should be strictly followed when calibrating or running a gamma ray density logger  needless exposure to the radiation from the tool when it is at the surface should be avoided  logging company personnel should have current radiation tr

from certain process streams  refrigeration in natural gas treating is a process that serves a dual dewpoint control function   namely  it is used to meet the hydrocarbon dewpoint as well as the water dewpoint specification for residue or sales gas      dewpoint control by refrigeration     the temperature to which the gas is cooled depends first on meeting these dewpoint specifications  this is the minimum cooling requirement  cooling the gas to lower temperatures than the minimum temperature for dewpoint control has to be justified by the economics of liquefied petroleum gas  lpg  recovery  this requires a cost analysis of the value of additional lpg recovery versus increased capital and operating costs  additional recovery of lpg is achieved by either of the following methods    chilling the gas to colder temperatures  such as       to        f  contacting the gas stream with lean oil in an absorption tower  refrigeration is basically pumping heat from one medium to another  heat by itself can only flow from a higher temperature medium to a lower temperature medium  thus  refrigeration is a process that provides the cooling medium to which the gas is exposed  refrigeration systems generally operate trouble free but can drop in efficiency  which requires investigation vargas  k j        troubleshooting compression refrigeration systems  chem  eng      march            fig       shows the typical refrigeration equipment for natural gas cooling  the heat exchanger cools the incoming gas to the refrigeration unit by exchanging heat with the cold gas  which has been chilled to the design cold temperature in the propane chiller    file vol  page     image      png    fig      schematic drawing of typical refrigeration dewpoint control process       because the gas entering the refrigeration unit is normally saturated with water vapor and the temperature to which the gas is cooled is substantially below the hydrate point of the gas  some means of preventing hydrate formation must be instituted  the formation temperature of hydrates at a given pressure can be suppressed by the addition of chemicals  such as methanol or glycol  in conventional refrigeration units  the common chemical used for hydrate suppression in the process gas is monoethylene glycol  usually referred to as    ethylene glycol  eg   glycol     glycol     glycol must be added to the natural gas being cooled at two points    the inlet to the gas gas heat exchanger  the inlet to the propane chiller  it is important to evenly distribute the glycol in the gas stream so that all gas is protected from freezing  this requires spraying the regenerated glycol evenly on to the tube sheet in these two vessels so that some glycol flows through each tube with the gas   propane  or some other refrigerant  boils in the chiller at a very low  controlled temperature  removing heat from the gas stream  thereby condensing a portion of the gas  the cold gas  condensate  and glycol flow from the chiller to a three phase separator  the condensate goes to a fractionation unit  the gas is sufficiently cooled so it meets both the hydrocarbon and water dewpoints  it exchanges heat with the incoming gas to the refrigeration process   the rich glycol is separated from the hydrocarbon gas stream in a three phase separator and is routed to a regenerator  the concentration of the regenerated glycol is usually on the order of    to     glycol  with the balance being water  sufficient glycol is injected at the two injection points to result in a mixture of water and glycol to depress the hydrate temperature to the required level  which for design purposes is the refrigerant boiling temperature   the amount of glycol to be injected requires a determination of the hydrate temperature depression and a calculation of the rich glycol concentration by the hammerschmidt equation   the refrigeration effect is brought about by the vaporization of a refrigerant  such as propane  in the chiller  propane is suited for this application  as it boils at temperatures near and below ambient temperatures  the vaporization of propane or boiling requires heat to effect the phase change from liquid to vapor   namely the latent heat of vaporization  by controlling the pressure at which the boiling of the propane takes place  the desired refrigeration temperature  down to about        f  is achieved      the ifpexol process     by using glycol to prevent hydrates from forming in the refrigeration process  a glycol regeneration process step must be incorporated in the overall equipment scheme  as shown in    fig        this includes an additional capital and operating cost burden to the refrigeration process  this cost burden can perhaps be somewhat reduced by using a relatively new innovation called the ifpexol process  which is illustrated in    fig          file vol  page     image

in the near wellbore area and reduces oil production  gas coning is distinctly different from  and should not be confused with  free gas production caused by a naturally expanding gas cap  likewise  water coning should not be confused with water production caused by a rising water oil contact  woc  from water influx  coning is a rate sensitive phenomenon generally associated with high producing rates  strictly a near wellbore phenomenon  it only develops once the pressure forces drawing fluids toward the wellbore overcome the natural buoyancy forces that segregate gas and water from oil      basis of terminology     the term coning is used because  in a vertical well  the shape of the interface when a well is producing the second fluid resembles an upright or inverted cone     fig         important examples of coning include    production of water in an oil well with bottomwater drive  production of gas in an oil well overlain by a gas cap  production of bottom water in a gas well   file vol  page      image      png    fig        coning in a vertical well       in a horizontal well  the cone becomes more of a crest     fig         but the phenomenon is still customarily called coning  in a given reservoir  the amount of undesired second fluid a horizontal well produces is usually less than for a vertical well under comparable conditions  this is a major motivation for drilling horizontal wells  for example  in thin oil columns underlain by water    file vol  page      image      png    fig        coning in a horizontal well          impact of coning     coning is a problem because the second phase must be handled at the surface in addition to the desired hydrocarbon phase  and the production rate of the hydrocarbon flow is usually dramatically reduced after the cone breaks through into the producing well  produced water must also be disposed of  gas produced from coning in an oil well may have a market  but also may not  in any event  production of gas in an oil well after the cone breaks through can rapidly deplete reservoir pressure and  for that reason  may force shut in of the oil well   several strategies may apply to wells with a potential to cone  one is to try to predict the rate at which a well will cone and produce at a lower rate as long as possible  or  optimal economics may result by producing at a much higher rate  causing the well to cone  but increasing the cumulative hydrocarbon volume produced  and present value  at any future date  a horizontal well may be preferred to a vertical well      predicting coning     most prediction methods for coning predict a  quot critical rate quot  at which a stable cone can exist from the fluid contact to the nearest perforations  the theory is that  at rates below the critical rate  the cone will not reach the perforations and the well will produce the desired single phase  at rates equal to or greater than the critical rate  the second fluid will eventually be produced and will increase in amount with time  however  these theories based on critical rates do not predict when breakthrough will occur nor do they predict water oil ratio or gas oil ratio  gor  after breakthrough  other theories predict these time behaviors  but their accuracy is limited because of simplifying assumptions   the calculated critical rate is valid only for a certain fixed distance between the fluid contact and the perforations  with time  that distance usually decreases  for example  bottom water will usually tend to rise toward the perforations   thus  the critical rate will tend to decrease with time  and the economics of a well with a tendency to cone will continue to deteriorate with time   whether a cone will move toward perforations depends on the relative significance of viscous and gravitational forces near a well  the pressure drawdown at the perforations tends to cause the undesired fluid to move toward the perforations  gravitational forces tend to cause the undesired fluid to stay away from the perforations  coning occurs when viscous forces dominate   the variables that could affect coning are    density differences between water and oil  gas and oil  or gas and water  gravitational forces   fluid viscosities and relative permeabilities  vertical and horizontal permeabilities  distances from contacts to perforations   coning tendency turns out to be quite dependent on some of these variables and insensitive to others   a number of prediction methods have been published  there is no guarantee of great accuracy when using any of these methods because they all contain significant simplifying assumptions  in particular  areal and vertical variations in vertical permeability  because of flow barriers of varying extent  can cause the prediction methods to differ significantly from what actually happens in the field  accordingly  the prediction methods

are several key managerial indicators or economic parameters that are considered  although there are many parameters that can be considered  see thompson and wright thompson  r s  and wright  j d   oil property evaluation  thompson wright associates  golden  colorado         chap      the most common decision criteria are    net present value  internal rate of return  profit to investment ratio  both discounted and undiscounted      net present value     net present value is the sum of the individual monthly or yearly net cash flows after they have been discounted with    eq       in    table       the three columns labeled  quot discounted net cash flow quot  show this calculation at annual discount rates of         and        the net present values  npv  at these discount rates are                   and     respectively  in this table  the npv were calculated on a monthly basis using effective monthly interest rates converted from annual rates with    eq        after the discounting method has been specified  there is still the question of what discount rate to use  the author recommends the company   s average investment opportunity rate  see thompson and wright  amp nbsp pages     and     and newendorp and schuyler newendorp  p d  and schuyler  j r   decision analysis for petroleum exploration  second edition  planning press  aurora  colorado         pages   through      the average investment opportunity rate is the interest rate that represents  on average  the return of the future investment opportunities available to the company  this is the rate at which the treasury will grow  an alternative interest rate is the weighted average cost of capital  wacc   this is an interest rate that  as the name indicates  is the average of the cost of each source of financing weighted by the fraction of the total financing that source represents  sources of financing include debt  which has an explicit interest rate associated with it  and equity  which has an implicit cost associated with attracting and retaining investors  the average investment opportunity rate and the weighted average cost of capital are often very similar to each other and often much lower than the typical  quot hurdle rates quot  used in the industry   the use of high discount rates to account for risk is not recommended  much has been written about the fallacy of using high discount rates  see  for example  capencapen  e c    quot property evaluation   a return to first principles  quot  paper spe       presented at the      spe hydrocarbon economics and evaluation symposium  dallas

average investment opportunity rate are acceptable  if the projects with a positive npv perform as projected  they will return more to the treasury than the average company project will return  in the case of mutually exclusive alternatives  where choosing one alternative precludes choosing another  the alternative with the highest npv should be chosen  an example of mutually exclusive alternatives might be choosing between injecting co  or high  pressure air as a secondary recovery method   only one or the other may be chosen  not both   rtenotitle                         rtenotitle                            internal rate of return     internal rate of return  irr  has been a popular managerial indicator since the     s  and it is still widely used today  irr is defined as that interest rate which  when used in the calculation of npv  causes the npv to be zero  in    table      that interest rate is        per month or        per year  notice that  once again  we are using the effective monthly interest rate and  therefore  must use    eq      to convert to annual interest rate   irr can easily be used to screen projects  if the irr is greater than the average investment opportunity rate  the project passes the screen  however  the unwary might be trapped in a situation where two mutually exclusive projects are being compared  many evaluators have a tendency to think that the project with the larger irr is the better project  this is not necessarily so  if irr is used to compare two mutually exclusive projects  it is necessary to calculate the irr on the incremental capital used for the project with the larger investment  although this can lead to the correct decision  the procedure is tedious enough that it is easier to just compare npvs at the average investment opportunity rate  choosing the project with the higher npv  at the average investment opportunity rate  leads to the same decision as calculating incremental irr    file vol  page

solids are captured in surface return tanks with sufficient volume to allow the solids to settle out of the fluid  where practical  the cleanout fluids are recirculated in the wellbore  thereby optimizing the cleanout program economics  one of the most important concerns in designing a solids cleanout program is the correct selection of the circulated fluid system  an overview of the two types of cleanout fluids used in ct services  categorized as    compressible    and    incompressible     is offered next       incompressible cleanout fluids      incompressible cleanout fluids are  for this discussion  limited to aqueous and hydrocarbon liquids  this type of cleanout program is the less complicated of the two categories  the cleanout fluid selected should be one that provides for solids removal in a    piston displacement    manner   the desired cleanout fluid is one that adequately transports solids out of the annulus  if circulation pump rates achieve annular velocities sufficient to exceed the terminal particle settling velocity  then newtonian fluids can be used  depending on the ct outside diameter  od  size  newtonian fluids are generally adequate when performing a cleanout inside of production tubing  however  when circulating cleanout fluids within large inside diameter  id  bore tubing or casing  the reduced annular velocities are typically insufficient to transport the solids out of the wellbore  in these cases  the cleanout fluid should be gelled to a higher viscosity  the non newtonian fluids used in this situation are generally sheared biopolymer gels or gelled oil systems       compressible cleanout fluids      compressible fluid cleanout programs are more difficult to design and implement than incompressible fluid cleanout programs  compressible fluids incorporate various fractions of gas in their composition and are selected to compensate for underpressured formations or where liquid cleanout fluid annular velocities are insufficient to lift solids  fluid volumes change relative to temperature and pressure in a compressible system  therefore  the annular velocities of these fluid returns do not travel at the same rates throughout the length of the annulus   once circulation is established in a compressible fluid cleanout program  unit volumes of fluid are pumped down the ct at pressures needed to overcome the total system friction pressure losses  in this condition  the compressible fluid is experiencing high pressure and occupies minimal volume  as the unit volume of compressible fluid exits the end of the ct  it begins its rise in the annulus  the decreasing hydrostatic pressure of the fluid in the annulus  coupled with a reduction in system friction pressure loss  allows the gas within the fluid to expand  the expanding gas within the fluid causes the velocity of the unit volume to increase  the expansion of the compressible

topics in the hydrocarbon production industry for many reasons  among these reasons are higher drilling costs  waste of natural resources  and the possible loss of human life when kicks and blowouts occur  one concern is the increasing number of governmental regulations and restrictions placed on the hydrocarbon industry  partially as a result of recent  much publicized well control incidents  for these and other reasons  it is important that drilling personnel understand well control principles and the procedures to follow to properly control potential blowouts     this chapter discusses the key elements that can be used to control kicks and prevent blowouts  these steps are based on the work of a blowout specialist and are briefly presented below      quickly shut in the well    when in doubt  shut down and get help  kicks occur as frequently while drilling as they do while tripping out of the hole  many small kicks turn into big blowouts because of improper handling    act cautiously to avoid mistakes   take your time to get it right the first time  you may not have another opportunity to do it correctly   these and other well control details are presented in detail throughout this chapter  unusual problems occurring during kick killing are discussed in other referenced sources    __toc__    introduction to kicks     various drilling problems confront operators daily  among these are lost circulation  stuck pipe  deviation control  and well control  the drilling problem specifically examined in this chapter is well control  other drilling problems will be presented as they relate to aspects of well control  one of the most pervasive problems with well control is the  quot kick  quot     a kick is a well control problem in which the pressure found within the drilled rock is higher than the mud hydrostatic pressure acting on the borehole or rock face  when this occurs  the greater formation pressure has a tendency to force formation fluids into the wellbore  this forced fluid flow is called a kick  if the flow is successfully controlled  the kick is considered to have been killed  an uncontrolled kick that increases in severity may result in what is known as a  quot blowout  quot      factors affecting kick severity     several factors affect the severity of a kick  one factor  for example  is the  quot permeability quot  of rock  which is its ability to allow fluid to move through the rock  another factor affecting kick severity is  quot porosity  quot  porosity measures the amount of space in the rock containing fluids  a rock with high permeability and high porosity has greater potential for a severe kick than a rock with low permeability and low porosity  for example  sandstone is considered to have greater kick potential than shale because sandstone  in general  has greater permeability and greater porosity than shale     and yet another factor affecting kick severity is the  quot pressure differential quot  involved  pressure differential is the difference between the formation fluid pressure and the mud hydrostatic pressure  if the formation pressure is much greater than the hydrostatic pressure  a large negative differential pressure exists  if this negative differential pressure is coupled with high permeability and high porosity  a severe kick may occur      kick labels     a kick can be labeled in several ways  including one that depends on the type of formation fluid that entered the borehole  known kick fluids include gas  oil  salt water  magnesium chloride water  hydrogen sulfide  sour  gas  and carbon dioxide  if gas enters the borehole  the kick is called a  quot gas kick  quot  furthermore  if a volume of    bbl      m   of gas entered the borehole  the kick could be termed a    bbl      m   gas kick     another way of labeling kicks is by identifying the required mud weight increase necessary to control the well and kill a potential blowout  for example  if a kick required a     lbm gal     kg m   mud weight increase to control the well  the kick could be termed a     lbm gal     kg m   kick  it is interesting to note that an average kick requires approximately     lbm gal     kg m    or less  mud weight increase      other factors affecting well control     another important consideration in well control is the pressure the formation rock can withstand without sustaining an induced fracture  this rock strength is often called the  quot fracture mud weight  quot  or  quot gradient  quot  and is usually expressed in lbm gal of equivalent mud weight     the  quot equivalent mud weight quot  is the summation of pressures exerted on the borehole wall and includes mud hydrostatic pressure  pressure surges caused by pipe movement  friction pressures applied against the formation as a result of pumping the drilling fluid  or any casing pressure caused by a kick  for example  if t

largely through the geometry of sources and receivers  a method similar to triangulation is used to place reflections in their correct locations with  more or less  correct amplitudes  which can then be interpreted  the amplitudes are indicative of relative changes in impedance  and the seismic volume can be processed to yield impedances between the reflecting boundaries      stacking and interval velocities     the geometry of sources and receivers in a typical reflection seismic survey yields a number of seismic traces with common midpoints or central bins for stacking  these traces were recorded at different offset distances  and the travel times for seismic waves traveling to and from a given reflecting horizon varies with that distance     fig         if the overburden through which the seismic waves pass is of constant velocity  then the time variation with distance is a simple application of pythagorean geometry  and the shape of the reflector on a seismic    gather    of traces is hyperbolic yilmaz  o        seismic data analysis  processing  inversion  and interpretation of seismic data  no      investigations in geophysics  soc  of exploration geophysicists  tulsa  as the overburden velocity structure becomes more complex  the shape is less perfectly hyperbolic  but most standard processing routines still assume a hyperbolic    moveout    of each reflector  an analysis is then made of selected seismic gathers to establish the ideal moveout required to    flatten    each reflection in the gather  this moveout is expressed in terms of a velocity and represents the seismic velocity that the entire overburden  down to the point of each particular reflection  would have to result in the idealized hyperbolic shape observed  this velocity analysis is usually conducted by examining the semblance  or some other measure of similarity  across all the traces  within a moving time window  and for all reasonable stacking velocities     fig         the seismic processor then selects the best set of velocities to use at a variety of reflectors and constructs a velocity function of two way travel time  these velocity functions are interpolated  both spatially and in two way travel time  and all seismic gathers are then    corrected for normal moveout    using them  each moveout corrected gather is then summed or    stacked    after eliminating     muting     those portions of the traces that have been highly distorted by the moveout process    file vol   f     jpg    fig      ray diagram for normal moveout and a synthetic seismic gather  at the top of the figure is a schematic ray diagram  showing an earth model with four reflecting interfaces  rays are drawn from three source locations to three receiver locations  as they are reflected from two of the interfaces  the other source receiver rays and reflections from other interfaces are not shown   the lower part of the figure shows the seismograms that would be recorded from this

values of semblance  or some other measure of similarity  according to a range of stacking velocities  the contours indicate the level of semblance  and the processing geophysicist selects the values deemed to be because of primary reflections and not events reflected multiple times  the direct wave  straight line arrivals seen at the upper edge of the arrivals on the seismic gather  are not considered in the analysis  after yilmaz        the final stacked traces exhibit a considerably better signal to noise ratio than the individual seismic traces recorded at zero offset  but the improvement is better than just the square root of the number of traces that might be expected because of the systematic removal of coherent noise  much of the noise present in individual seismic traces is not random but represents unwanted events  including surface waves or ground roll and multiply reflected arrivals from shallow horizons  both of these can usually be identified in the velocity analysis and selected against  the stacking process then removes most of the unaligned energy associated with these types of coherent noise   the velocities obtained in the analysis previously described are not true seismic velocities   they are simply those velocities which provided the best stack of the data and may or may not truly reflect the actual root mean square  rms  velocities that approximate the accumulated effect of the stack of layers above the reflector  the name rms is derived from the arithmetic used to

which we build the models  interpretations  and predictions of petroleum engineering  as well as geology and geophysics  we consider here the properties of sedimentary rocks  particularly those that make up hydrocarbon reservoirs  usually  these consist of sandstones  limestones  and dolomites  we must be more inclusive  and consider rocks such as shales  evaporates  and diatomites because these provide the seals  bounding materials  or source rocks to our reservoirs  it is important to note that shales and claystones make up the most abundant rock type in the typical sedimentary column  features such as seismic signature depend as much on the enclosing shale as on the reservoir sands     in this chapter  we will tabulate important mineral and rock properties  and provide many of the mathematical models used to describe and predict properties  much of this summary is drawn upon the extensive work and compellations already available  as examples  clark provides an extensive list of mineral and rock properties  birch presents tables of compressional velocities  and gregory gives a detailed overview of the use of rock property information in seismic interpretation  castagna   et al    focused on rock properties for use in amplitude versus offset analyses  useful handbooks on this topic include carmichael and lama and vutukuri  probably the best reference covering a wide range of rock property formulas and models is mavko   et al    these references can be consulted for details not presented here        knowledge of rock properties is largely empirical      many theoretical models have been developed to predict or correlate specific physical properties of porous rock  most theoretical models are built on simplified physical concepts  what are the properties of an ideal porous media  however  in comparison with real rocks  these models are always oversimplified  they must be  to be solvable   most of these models are capable of  quot forward modeling quot  or predicting rock properties with one or more arbitrary parameters  however  as is typical in earth science  our models cannot be inverted from measurements to predict uniquely real rock and pore fluid properties  many efforts have been made and will continue to be made to build porous rock models  but progress is very limited  some of the most fundamental questions are still unanswered     to establish the basic relationships between physical properties and rock parameters  laboratory investigations are made  laboratory measurements of rock samples can provide controlled conditions and high data quality   quot hard data quot    these relationships can be extended to a larger scale  or can even be made scaleless  typically  models and relations based on laboratory data are then applied to in situ measurements to derive the parameters we actually need  say  permeability  from information we can actually collect  say  density and gamma ray radiation   the relative merits and problems associated with several rock and fluid measurement techniques are presented in    table             file vol  page     image      png    table           although many empirical relationships already have been established  when facing a frontier basin  new development areas  or untested portions of known formations  valid prediction of rock properties usually requires core data  including  quot sidewall quot  plugs   for many applications  standard trend data may not be adequate  a broad investigation is needed        philosophy for rock properties      many of the factors affecting rock properties are incompletely ascertained  for example  acoustic velocities can be affected by numerous parameters  many of which cannot be measured  in addressing a rock physics problem  the following aspects should be remembered     there may be no exact solution    rock properties are controlled by rock parameters  and these physical correlations can be examined and recognized  although perhaps not understood     often nature gives us a break  at certain conditions  relationships between the rock properties and rock parameters can be simplified  such as archie   s law     we usually must settle on imperfect solutions with some uncertainty  statistical trends or high and low bounds might be used to handle the uncertainty    every measurement is  to some degree  wrong  the question is  can we tolerate the errors and understand how they propagate through our analyses   we will begin this chapter with a suite of definitions and examples  then move on to data and models of individual properties  by necessity  we will be restricted in the material we can cover in a single chapter  as a result  we will not go into many details of rock fabrics and petrography  also  with a few exceptions  the information provided here assumes that rocks are homogeneous and isotropic          rocks  minerals

 quot thick quot  a fluid is  for example  molasses is characterized as being  quot thicker quot  and more viscous than water  the viscosity of a fluid or solution may  in general terms  be defined as the solution   s resistance to being sheared or as the resistance of a fluid mass to change its form   fluid viscosity          is defined as  rtenotitle                         where        is shear

purpose of oil or gas production  or injecting materials into underground formations  must be cased with material with sufficient strength and functionality      casing     casing is the major structural component of a well  casing is needed to    maintain borehole stability  prevent contamination of water sands  isolate water from producing formations  control well pressures during drilling  production  and workover operations  casing provides locations for the installation of    blowout preventers  wellhead equipment  production packers  production tubing  the cost of casing is a major part of the overall well cost  so selection of casing size  grade  connectors  and setting depth is a primary engineering and economic consideration       casing strings      there are six basic types of casing strings    conductor casing  surface casing  intermediate casing  production casing  liner  liner tieback casing       conductor casing       conductor casing is the first string set below the structural casing  i e   drive pipe or marine conductor run to protect loose near surface formations and to enable circulation of drilling fluid   the conductor isolates unconsolidated formations and water sands and protects against shallow gas  this is usually the string onto which the casing head is installed  a diverter or a blowout prevention  bop  stack may be installed onto this string  when cemented  this string is typically cemented to the surface or to the mudline in offshore wells        surface casing       surface casing is set to provide blowout protection  isolate water sands  and prevent lost circulation  it also often provides adequate shoe strength to drill into high pressure transition zones  in deviated wells  the surface casing may cover the build section to prevent keyseating of the formation during deeper drilling  this string is typically cemented to the surface or to the mudline in offshore wells        intermediate casing       intermediate casing is set to isolate    unstable hole sections  lost circulation zones  low pressure zones  production zones  it is often set in the transition zone from normal to abnormal pressure  the casing cement top must isolate any hydrocarbon zones  some wells require multiple intermediate strings  some intermediate strings may also be production strings if a liner is run beneath them        production casing       production casing is used to isolate production zones and contain formation pressures in the event of a tubing leak  it may also be exposed to    injection pressures from fracture jobs  downcasing  gas lift  the injection of inhibitor oil  a good primary cement job is very critical for this string        liner       liner is a casing string that does not extend back to the wellhead  but is hung from another casing string  liners are used instead of full casing strings to    reduce cost  improve hydraulic performance when drilling deeper  allow the use of larger tubing above the liner top  not represent a tension limitation for a rig  liners can be either an intermediate or a production string  liners are typically cemented over their entire length        liner tieback string       liner tieback string is a casing string that provides additional pressure integrity from the liner top to the wellhead  an intermediate tieback is used to isolate a casing string that cannot withstand possible pressure loads if drilling is continued  usually because of excessive wear or higher than anticipated pressures   similarly  a production tieback isolates an intermediate string from production loads  tiebacks can be uncemented or partially cemented  an example of a typical casing program that illustrates each of the specified casing string types is shown in    fig          file devol      final page     image      png    fig      typical casing program          tubing     tubing is the conduit through which oil and gas are brought from the producing formations to the field surface facilities for processing  tubing must be adequately strong to resist loads and deformations associated with production and workovers  further  tubing must be sized to support the expected rates of production of oil and gas  clearly  tubing that is too small restricts production and subsequent economic performance of the well  tubing that is too large  however  may have an economic impact beyond the cost of the tubing string itself  because the tubing size will influence the overall casing design of the well       properties of casing and tubing      the

problems  now  however  state of the art computers can perform these complex calculations in a reasonable time frame  making possible a wave of new studies      vibration theory     a vibration is a fluctuating motion about an equilibrium state  there are two types of vibration  deterministic and random  a deterministic vibration is one that can be characterized precisely  whereas a random vibration only can be analyzed statistically  the vibration generated by a pumping unit is an example of a deterministic vibration  and an intermittent sticking problem within the same system is a

that can describe a system response  these independent coordinates are known as degrees of freedom  dofs   if the motion of mass  either translational or rotational  of a vibrating system is a function of only one independent coordinate  then the system has one dof  if two or more independent coordinates are required to describe one or both types of motion  then the system has two or more dofs  if a system is continuous  an infinite set of independent coordinates is needed to describe the system response   it has an infinite number of dofs  because material structures all have a continuous nature  all systems have an infinite number of dofs  most systems have dominant dofs  some even have a single dominant dof  such systems therefore can be characterized as discrete systems  which makes the mathematics more tractable   if a system has a single dof or set of dofs in only one direction  it is a  d system  if there are two mutually orthogonal directions for the dof  it is a  d system  and if there are three mutually orthogonal directions for the dof  it is a  d system   as    fig       shows  the excitation function can be periodic or transient  and absent or present  a

to capture fluid flow behavior that is lost because of the integration of fine scale geologic features in the upscaling process  phase behavior treatment can range from simple black oil pvt to

i e   estimated at  gt       of pc pumps in use downhole are of the single lobe design and thus are the primary focus of this page  other variations of these basic configurations include semi elliptical rotor stator geometries and uniform thickness elastomer pumps       single lobe pc pump      the geometric design of a single lobe pc pump is illustrated in    fig        the longitudinal cross section in    fig       shows the single external helical shape of the rotor and the corresponding double internal helical geometry of the stator  note that the stator pitch length  ls  is exactly double the rotor pitch length in single lobe pumps  with the mating of the rotor and stator in a single lobe pc pump  two parallel  helical cavities are formed        apart and one rotor pitch out of phase  that spiral around the outside of the rotor along the pump length  with each cavity having a length equal to the stator pitch length  note that the parallel cavities are offset lengthwise  with the end of a cavity on one side of the rotor corresponding to the maximum cavity cross section on the opposite side  in a single lobe pump  the rotor is circular in cross section  with a minor diameter    d     whereas the cavity within the stator has a semi elliptical geometry  another important geometric parameter is the pump eccentricity  e   which is equal to the distance between the centerlines of the major and minor diameters of the rotor  the distance between the stator axis and rotor major diameter axis is also equal to the eccentricity value  the rotor creates an interference fit seal with the stator elastomer on both sides of the semi elliptical opening and a seal over the semicircular end of the stator opening at the positions corresponding to the ends of the longitudinal fluid cavities  the fluid filled cavities are formed by the open areas left between the rotor and stator at each cross section     fig       shows a section view of a single lobe pc

through a metal forming process  in most cases  the rotors are coated with a thin layer of wear resistant material  usually chrome  to resist abrasion and then are polished to a smooth finish to reduce rotor stator friction  rotors are also fabricated from various stainless steels for service in corrosive or acidic environments because these materials are less susceptible to corrosive fluid

foot  even though most modern wireline logs are recorded digitally every   in  many of the world   s reservoirs are logged in metric units  and thickness is expressed in meters  in this regime  thickness is rounded to the nearest     m   bed boundaries are usually the easiest of all reservoir properties to measure  however  there are some fatal traps that await the unwary  the geologist   s knowledge of the rock types in the play  in general  and in the well of interest  in particular  can be used      sands and shales     the term sand is used generically and can also refer to sandstone or other siliciclastic formations  the term shale is used generically and can also refer to mudrock or claystone  when the reservoir beds are mostly sand  typically low gamma ray  gr   and shale  typically high gr   then the gr log can usually be used to select bed boundaries  the inflection point of the gr count rate expressed in american petroleum institute  api  units is selected as the bed boundary   see examples in the article on nuclear logging  the choice of which bed thickness is to be determined is usually made by the geologist largely on the basis of pattern recognition skills developed during the play definition  not all sand beds have low gr levels  if the sand bed contains sizable amounts of potassium feldspar  mica  or volcanic debris  the sands may be as radioactive as the shales and difficult to tell apart  in this case  the spontaneous potentials  sp  log is often used if the well is drilled in water based mud  again  the inflection point of the log is used to denote the bed boundary   see examples in resistivity and sp logging  however  in low porosity and high resistivity environments  the sp is suppressed and cannot be relied on as a bed boundary indicator   another tool that can be used to mark bed boundaries is the electric  resistivity or conductivity  log  this log is most useful when the shales are water bearing and the sands are shale free and hydrocarbon bearing  however  the bed boundary is no longer at the inflection point on the log  but is offset by one half of the electrode spacing of the tool used to measure resistivity  each service company has charts to aid the petrophysicist in determining the correct offset  while many wellsite computer products take this offset into account automatically  the finest resolution of all is afforded by electric or acoustic borehole image logs  but these logs are not routinely run because of their expensive acquisition and processing costs  the pages on specialized well logging topics shows examples of borehole image logs  if the well is drilled in oil based mud  then the sp log is not available and the density neutron log can be used to define sand from shale  if the density neutron log is a modern digitally sampled tool  then the inflection point can be used as the bed boundary  if  however  the density neutron log is an older analog tool  the bed boundary can be offset because of drag settings  vendor publications are available to aid the user in determining the offset  acoustic borehole image logs are an option in small boreholes and lightweight oil based muds  nuclear magnetic resonance  nmr  logs are also useful in distinguishing zones that have movable fluids from those containing bound fluids  see nuclear magnetic resonance  nmr  logging for examples       carbonates     when the reservoir beds are generally composed of carbonates  i e   limestones and or dolomites   bed definition becomes more complex  in this case  the presence and absence of porosity defines the reservoir from the seal  thus  the gr log may not be useful in demarking bed boundaries  likewise  carbonates are generally in a higher resistivity regime  and the sp log is of little use  thus  in this environment  one relies on a tool sensitive to porosity to delineate the bed boundaries  such as the density  neutron  or acoustic log  borehole image logs are also useful when the borehole is relatively smooth  large vugs and washouts invalidate readings from these tools   the page on specialized logging topics includes an example of a borehole image log in a carbonate formation       what to count     determining gross bed thickness is straightforward  however  determining what part of a given bed contains producible hydrocarbons is tricky  at present  there is no single standard sanctioned by spe or api as to the definition of  or the method for determining  net pay  one of the more common complications is a result of the small thickness of layers containing hydrocarbons  some common depositional environments can result in sands and shales being laid down into zones thinner than the resolving power of almost all wireline logs  one cannot count directly what one cannot see  in this case  we settle for thicker averages that mathematically equate to correct fluid volumes

spent to develop subsea separation and pumping systems  but because of unresolved technical issues  along with a lack of confidence and clear understanding of the costs and benefits  industry did not rush to deploy the technology on a commercial basis  however  as the industry has moved into remote deep and ultradeep water  various degrees of subsea processing are becoming more common  in deep water  the technology can enable hydrocarbon recovery from small reservoirs that are subeconomic by conventional means  making small fields economically viable and large fields even more profitable   the benefits of subsea processing have been recognized for several decades  however  with production limited to shallow waters  the risk of deploying a new technology was too great compared to the potential rewards  topside processing facilities were relatively inexpensive  and conventional technologies were adequate to achieve acceptable reservoir performance and project economics  consequently  subsea processing remained an academic interest until the     s       conventional technologies      among conventional artificial lift systems  gas lift is closest in principle to subsea processing  electric submersible pump  esp  systems  which degas and pump the resultant liquid at the wellbore  should be compared with downhole processing  both subsea separation and gas lift function by reducing the hydrostatic head of the fluid column  however  unlike subsea separation  gas lift can never achieve the low gas hydraulic pressure gradient  as more gas is injected  additional pressure drop imposed by flow induced friction overtakes the benefit of lower fluid density  in vertical parts of tubing or pipeline  lift gas injection can actually reduce flow efficiency  because gas lift does not improve horizontal flows  gas lift has limited applications for long distance tiebacks or highly deviated wells       driven by economics      the compelling reason for subsea processing is to improve field development profitability  benchmark data of deepwater   gt      m water depth  offshore developments clearly indicate two primary contributing factors for

involvement and influence in the industry with this global expansion of the petroleum industry has come ongoing technological development that provides better tools and techniques for analyzing reservoirs and reservoir fluids as well as greater understanding of how reservoir geology affects reservoir performance  in developing mathematical models that replicate the geologic environment  the reservoir engineer must incorporate all available hard technical data and work closely with and use fully the experience of multidisciplinary teams of geophysicists  geologists  petrophysicists  and other specialists  the engineer must develop a working knowledge of the skills contributed by each member of the reserves assessment team and apply the professional judgment of each team member to the

industries inc            installation     the inboard end of the ct may be connected either to the hollow segment of the reel shaft  spoke and axle design   or to a high pressure piping segment  concave flange plates   both of which are then connected to a high pressure rotating swivel  this high pressure fluid swivel is secured to a stationary piping manifold  which provides connection to the treatment fluid pumping system  as a result  continuous pumping and circulation can be maintained throughout the job  a high pressure shutoff valve should be installed between the ct and reel shaft swivel for emergency use in isolating the tubing from the surface pump lines  the reel should also have a mechanism to prevent accidental rotational movement of the drum when it is required to remain stationary  in any event  the reel supporting structure should be secured to the deck or surface grade on location to prevent movement during operations   in addition to the fluid pumping service of the reel  electric wireline may be installed within the ct string to provide a means for conducting logging and downhole tool manipulation operations  the wireline is run inside the ct  and is terminated at the reel shaft within a pressure bulkhead on the ct manifold  the single or multi conductor cable is run from the pressure bulkhead to a rotating electric connection  slip collector ring  similar to that found on electric wireline units  on reels equipped for electric line service  this electric connection may be located on the reel shaft opposite the rotating fluid swivel or at the pressure bulkhead adjacent to the inboard swivel piping      service reel operation     in preparation for initial installation  a wing union is typically welded onto the end of the ct to be hooked up to the high pressure piping within the reel  typically referred to as the    reference    end   the mechanical connection is inserted through a slot in the reel core drum  and made up to the high pressure piping  once the connection has been properly terminated  the tube is bent over a preset guide to create a reasonably smooth bend transition to the outer surface of the core drum   the initial layer of the tubing is spooled across the core drum until the tubing wrap reaches the opposing flange  then  the tubing is spooled back over the base layer  resting in the recesses between the tubes on the previous layer  this wrapping process is continued through the remaining successive layers until the desired amount of tubing is spooled onto the reel  the manner in which the tubing is wrapped onto the reel allows the tube to be supported within the space formed by the previously wrapped tubing and offers a unique stacking geometry   the core radius of the service reel defines the smallest bending radius for the tubing  for ct used repeatedly in well intervention and drilling applications  the core radius should be at least    times the specified outside diameter  od  of the ct  this factor may be less for ct that will be bend cycled only a few times  such as for permanent installations   the rotation of the service reel is controlled by a hydraulic motor  which may be mounted as a direct drive on the reel shaft  or operated by a chain and sprocket drive assembly  this motor is used to provide a given tension on the tubing  thereby maintaining the pipe tightly wrapped on the reel  back pressure is kept on the reel motor during deployment  keeping tension on the tubing between the injector and service reel  this tensile load applied to the tubing by the reel motor is commonly called    reel back tension     requiring the injector to pull the tubing off the reel  the amount of reel back tension required increases with an increase in ct od  yield strength  increased bending stiffness of the tubing   and distance between the service reel and injector  in addition  the required load on the reel drive system increases as the size of the core radius increases  note that this tension results in an axial load imposed onto the tubing guide arch and creates a bending moment that is applied to the top of the injector  therefore  it is critical that the injector is secured properly so that the bending moment is not translated to the well control stack components or wellhead   during operations  the reel back tension also prevents the tubing from    springing     although the ct stored on a service reel has been plastically deformed during the spooling process  the tubin

layered  complex reservoir system  to obtain the data needed to understand the fluid flow properties  the mechanical properties and the depositional environment of a specific reservoir requires that cores be cut  handled correctly  and tested in the laboratory using modern and sophisticated laboratory methods  of primary importance is measuring the rock properties under restored reservoir conditions  the effect of net overburden pressure  nob  must be reproduced in the laboratory to obtain the most accurate quantitative information from the cores   to provide all the data needed to characterize the reservoir and depositional system  a core should be cut in the pay interval and in the layers of rock above and below the pay interval  core from the shales and mudstones above and below the pay interval help the geologist determine the environment of deposition  knowing more about the deposition allows the reservoir engineer to better estimate the morphology and size of the gas bearing reservoir layers  also  mechanical property tests can be run on the shales to determine estimates of poisson   s ratio and young   s modulus  additional tests can be run to measure the shale density and the sonic travel time in the shale to assist in the analyses of the density  and sonic log data      handling and testing cores     after cutting the cores in the field  it is important to handle the core properly    the core should not be hammered out of the barrel  it should be pumped out   once the core is laid out on the pipe racks  it should be wiped with rags to remove the mud  do not wash with water   then described as quickly as possible  bedding features  natural fractures  and lithology should be described foot by foot  permanent markers should be used to label the depth of the core and clearly mark the up direction on the core   as quickly as feasible  the core should be wrapped in heat shrinking plastic  then sealed in paraffin for the trip to the core analysis laboratory   precautions should be taken to minimize alteration of the core properties while retrieving and describing the core in the field   once in the laboratory  the core is unwrapped and slabbed  and plugs are cut for testing  normally  a core plug should be cut every foot in the core  trying to properly sample all the rock   not just the cleaner pay zones  routine core analyses can be run on these core plugs  once the routine core analyses are completed  additional core plugs are cut for special core analyses  sometimes samples of whole core are used for testing  both the routine and the special core analyses are required to calibrate the openhole logging data  and to prepare the data sets required to design the optimum completion  the core plugs must also be treated with care  for example  if a core plug from a shaly sand is placed in a standard oven  it is likely that the clays in the pores will be altered as they dry out  a more accurate core analysis usually is achieved if the core plugs are dried in a humidity controlled oven in which the free water is evaporated  but the bound clay water is not affected      routine core analyses     routine core analyses should be run on core plugs cut every foot along the core  routine core analyses should consist of measurements of    grain density  porosity and permeability to air  both unstressed and stressed   cation exchange capacity  fluid saturations analysis  in addition  each core plug should be described in detail to understand the lithology and grain size and to note any natural fractures and other details that could be of importance to the geologist  petrophysicist  or engineer   the porosity is used to determine values of gas in place and to develop correlations with permeability  the grain density should be used to determine how to correlate the density log values and to validate any calculation of lithology from log data  the cation exchange capacity can be used to determine how much electric current can be transmitted by the rock rather than the fluid in the pore space  the cation exchange capacity must be measured in the laboratory  using samples of rock  and is a function of the amount and type of clay in the rock  saturation analysis measures the amount of water  oil  and gas in the core plugs in the laboratory  saturation analysis can be misleading in rocks that are cored with water based mud because of mud filtrate invasion during the coring process and problems that occur with core retrieval and handling prior to running the laboratory tests  however  the values of water saturation from the core analysis of cores cut with an oil based mud can be used to calibrate the log data and to estimate values of gas in place in the reservoir   the measurements of porosity and permeability are a function of the net stress applied to the rock when the measurements are taken  for low porosity ro

wellbore fluid      tool     the fluid capacitance logging tool includes an inside dielectric probe located on the tool   s axis  the probe is surrounded by an outside housing that is open to the wellbore fluid  together  the probe  the housing  and the fluid constitute an electrical capacitor  the capacitance level of which depends on the particular fluid  or fluids  within the capacitor   circuitry within the tool is connected to the electrical capacitor  with the result that the circuitry generates an oscillating signal that varies inversely with the capacitance level  water has the greatest capacitive effect  resulting in the lowest frequency  gas has the least capacitive effect  resulting in the highest frequency  the frequency with oil is intermediate to those of water and gas  however  the oil frequency is much closer to the gas frequency than to the water frequency  consequently  the tool distinguishes principally between water and hydrocarbons      calibration     preferably  the tool is calibrated at the surface in produced water from the well  establishing the trace for water  normally  the recording system is adjusted so that the water trace is at the left edge of the track  air customarily establishes the trace for gas  normally  the recording system is adjusted so that the air trace is at the right edge of the track  if the well produces any oil  the tool can be calibrated in produced oil  establishing the trace for oil  sometimes tap water is used to establish the water trace      application     obviously  the tool poses no hazard to personnel who are exposed to it at the surface  if the tool is dropped into the well and it must be left there  it is not necessary to cement it over  as with a nuclear tool  furthermore  the recording sensitivity can be greatly increased above normal sensitivity because the tool produces a signal that is  quot clean quot   free of statistical events   unlike a nuclear tool  at such an increased sensitivity  the tool can detect the slightest  quot whiff quot  of hydrocarbon that passes close enough to its sensor  with the sensitivity increased  the tool also can detect very small amounts of water dispersed in oil   a small gas entry into water looks to the fluid capacitance tool just about the same as a small oil entry  whereas the small oil entry  because of its low density contrast with water  changes the fluid density only slightly  the small gas entry  because of its low density relative to water  changes the density log significantly  thus  by a comparison of the two log types  an analyst can fathom the nature of a hydrocarbon entry   from the prior discussion  it is obvious that the fluid capacitance tool can distinguish between water and the two hydrocarbons  but it cannot distinguish one hydrocarbon from the other  also  the tool has a very nonlinear response over the range from water to hydrocarbon  during use downhole  there can be a calibration drift because of filming of the housing or the dielectric probe  or both  if the drift is severe  the film possibly can be removed with the tool pulled into the tubing  where the velocity of flow may be high enough to remove the film   in a production well  the tool should be logged down at a logging speed between    and    ft min  maintain a constant logging speed  and use the same speed for all passes  the log should begin at a location above the perforations and end at the deepest depth that can be reached  in a slugging or churning multiphase flow  the log may show variable behavior  even in intervals that are not perforated  in that case  another logging run is advisable to establish the degree of repeatability  if results are less than desirable  a stationary measurement can be time averaged at each selected location  usually  a log is run with the well shut in after flow  if the well has been shut in before logging  a shut in log can be recorded  but the well must flow for   or   hours before the first flowing log      example        fig       pertains to a well producing       rb d at     oil and     water  notice the shut in log  left trace   at the bottom  below the perforations  the water response is near the left edge of the track  at       ft  the log shows a water oil interface in the wellbore  in the oil above the interface  the response appears near the right edge of the track  in gas  the response would be approximately       hz    file vol  page      image      png    fig        fluid capacitance surveys from a well that produces       rb d      oil      water

statement and how mathematical analysis can be used to answer transient flow problems  this broad area is common to many other disciplines  such as heat conduction in solids and groundwater hydrology  the objective is to introduce the fundamentals of transient analysis  present examples  and guide the interested reader to relevant references   most physical phenomena in the domain of transient fluid flow in porous media can be described generally by partial differential equations  pdes   with appropriate boundary conditions and sometimes with simplifying assumptions  the pde leads to an initial boundary value problem  ibvp  that is solved to find a mathematical statement of the resulting flow in the porous medium  this page briefly discusses the statement of the ibvp for transient fluid flow in porous media      equations of transient fluid flow in porous media     in essence  fluid motion in porous media can be specified by the knowledge of the velocity vector  rtenotitle  and the density of the fluid          as a function of the position    x      y      z    and time    t    that is  rtenotitle   rtenotitle    x      y      z      t    and                   x      y      z      t     relative to the fixed cartesian axes  the velocity vector can be written as  rtenotitle                         where   v    x      v    y    and   v    z   are the velocity components  and rtenotitle  rtenotitle  and rtenotitle are the unit vectors in the   x      y    and   z   directions  respectively   the physical law governing the macroscopic fluid flow phenomena in porous media is the conservation of mass  which states that mass is neither created nor destroyed  the mathematical formula of this rule is developed by considering the flow through a fixed arbitrary closed surface      lying entirely within a porous medium of porosity          which is filled with a fluid of viscosity            fig       illustrates an arbitrary closed surface in porous medium    file vol  page     image      png    fig        arbitrary closed surface    in porous medium       the conservation of mass principle requires that the difference between the rates at which fluid enters and leaves the volume through its surface must equal the rate at which mass accumulates within the volume  the total mass within the volume at any time is given by  rtenotitle                         then  the time rate of change of mass within    is  rtenotitle                         which  by the conservation of mass law  is equal to the rate at which mass enters   v   through the surface   consider the differential surface element  d    shown in    fig        the mass entering the volume through d   at the normal velocity  rtenotitle  in a time increment      t    is rtenotitle  and the total mass of the fluid passing through    during     t   is  rtenotitle                         the surface integral in    eq       accounts for both influx and outflux through the surface of the volume  that is      m    g   is the difference between the masses entering and leaving the control volume during the time increment      t    then  the mass rate entering the volume    v    through its surface      can be written as  rtenotitle                         by the principle of conservation of mass  equating the right sides of    eqs       and         yields  rtenotitle                          a more useful relation is found with the divergence theorem  which states that the flux of rtenotitle through the closed surface      is identical to the volume integral of rtenotitle  the divergence of rtenotitle  taken throughout   v    that is   rtenotitle                         here      is the gradient operator  which in  d cartesian and cylindrical coordinates is given  respectively  by  rtenotitle                         and  rtenotitle                         with the relation in    eq           eq       can be recast into  rtenotitle                          if

three key factors that drive decisions about the type of drilling fluid selected for a specific well are    cost  technical performance  environmental impact   selecting the correct type of fluid for the specific conditions is an important part of successful drilling operations      classification of drilling fluids     world oil   s annual classification of fluid systemsworld oil      drilling

pneumatic  air  mist  foam  gas     fluid    systems  three key factors usually determine the type of fluid selected for a specific well    cost  technical performance  environmental impact  water based fluids  wbfs  are the most widely used systems  and are considered less expensive than oil based fluids  obfs  or synthetic based fluids  sbfs   the obfs and sbfs   also known as invert emulsion systems   have an oil or synthetic base fluid as the continuous or external  phase  and brine as the internal phase  invert emulsion systems have a higher cost per unit than most water based fluids  so they often are selected when well conditions call for reliable shale inhibition and or excellent lubricity  water based systems and invert emulsion systems can be formulated to tolerate relatively high downhole temperatures  pneumatic systems most commonly are implemented in areas where formation pressures are relatively low and the risk of lost circulation or formation damage is relatively high  the use of these systems requires specialized pressure management equipment to help prevent the development of hazardous conditions when hydrocarbons are encountered       water based fluids      water based fluids  wbfs  are used to drill approximately     of all wells oilfield market report       spears  amp  assoc  inc   tulsa  oklahoma  www spearsresearch com  the base fluid may be fresh water  seawater  brine  saturated brine  or a formate brine  the type of fluid selected depends on anticipated well conditions or on the specific interval of the well being drilled  for example  the surface interval typically is drilled with a low density water  or seawater based mud that contains few commercial additives  these systems incorporate natural clays in the course of the drilling operation  some commercial bentonite or attapulgite also may be added to aid in fluid loss control and to enhance hole cleaning effectiveness  after surface casing is set and cemented  the operator often continues drilling with a wbf unless well conditions require displacing to an oil  or synthetic based system   wbfs fall into two broad categories  nondispersed and dispersed         nondispersed sytems        simple gel and water systems used for tophole drilling are nondispersed  as are many of the advanced polymer systems that contain little or no bentonite  the natural clays that are incorporated into nondispersed systems are managed through dilution  encapsulation  and or flocculation  a properly designed solids control system can be used to remove fine solids from the mud system and help maintain drilling efficiency  the low solids  nondispersed  lsnd  polymer systems rely on high  and low molecular weight long chain polymers to provide viscosity and fluid loss control  low colloidal solids are encapsulated and flocculated for more efficient removal at the surface  which in turn decreases dilution requirements  specially developed high temperature polymers are available to help overcome gelation issues that might occur on high pressure  high temperature  hp ht  wells mason  w  and gleason  d        system designed for deep  hot wells  american oil and

chemical dispersants that are designed to deflocculate clay particles to allow improved rheology control in higher density muds  widely used dispersants include lignosulfonates  lignitic additives  and tannins  dispersed systems typically require additions of caustic soda  naoh  to maintain a ph level of      to       dispersing a system can increase its tolerance for solids  making it possible to weight up to      ppg  the commonly used lignosulfonate system relies on relatively inexpensive additives and is familiar to most operator and rig personnel  additional commonly used dispersed muds include lime and other cationic systems  a solids laden dispersed system also can decrease the rate of penetration significantly and contribute to hole erosion        saltwater drilling fluids       saltwater drilling fluids often are used for shale inhibition and for drilling salt formations  they also are known

rotors in a range of minor diameters for each pump model  the different rotor sizes are often categorized by standard  i e   nominal   single or double oversized or undersized designations or by different temperature ratings  the minor rotor diameter typically changes by      mm        in   per size increment  this allows individual pump models to be provided with various degrees of interference fit between the rotor and the stator  the task of selecting a    fit    that will result in optimal pump functionality under downhole conditions is often referred to as    pump sizing         overview     through experience  operators and pump suppliers have developed sizing guidelines for many different field applications  these applications are usually classified in terms of    fluid viscosity  temperature  fluid composition  i e   sand and water cut  aromatic and h s content  at downhole conditions  sizing guidelines take into account    anticipated elastomer expansion and swell  clearances for abrasives  fluid slippage rates  volumetric efficiency  for a given application  there is generally a relatively narrow range of acceptable volumetric efficiencies for the pump at rated pressure  as measured on a test bench under certain standard conditions  in some cases  the sizing guidelines may also contain limitations on maximum allowable friction torque   when a new pump is sized  an initial pump bench test is completed with a particular rotor and stator  depending on the results of this test  it may be necessary to conduct additional tests with different rotor sizes until a rotor stator combination is found that meets the predetermined sizing criteria  it is essential to bench test a pc pump to establish its performance characteristics quantitatively given the numerous design  material  and fabrication parameters that can affect the results  the following section describes bench testing equipment  practices  and results in further detail      pump testing

system  fluid is pumped through a closed loop system consisting of the pump  discharge lines  fluid reservoir  filtering system  and intake lines  in almost all cases  water with a small amount of oil added for lubrication is used as the test fluid  a choke on the discharge line is used to regulate the pump differential pressure  the test process normally consists of varying the discharge pressure while operating the pump at a constant speed  various test parameters are monitored and recorded  the discharge pressure is usually set at zero at the start of the test and is then sequentially increased to the maximum test pressure that  in most cases  matches or exceeds the rated pressure of the pump  depending on the manufacturer  this procedure is repeated at up to four different speeds  some manufacturers also determine the maximum pressure that a pump can withstand  this is done by completely restricting the pump discharge and measuring the pressure under that condition    file vol

temperature  fluid rate  torque  speed is directly measured with any one of several mechanical  magnetic  or optical techniques  all of which generally provide quite accurate measurements  discharge pressure is monitored with either a pressure gauge or pressure transducer  depending on the type of instrument  the accuracy and resolution of the pressure measurements can vary substantially  several different methods are commonly used to measure fluid rates  these include measuring the time required to fill a specific volume in a tank  use of a flowmeter or measuring mass changes in the discharge reservoir with time  except for properly sized flowmeters  the reliability of measurements made with these techniques increases with sample size  volume or mass   pump torques are determined either directly with the use of a load cell installed on the drive rod or indirectly by monitoring hydraulic pressure in a hydraulic drive system or by monitoring prime mover current in an electric drive system  in general  the further removed the measurement point is from the pump rotor  the more the torque values

regulator and pressure regulator are required to control the amount of gas injected during the drilling process       cryonic generation      the use of tanked nitrogen could be considered on onshore locations  where a large truck could be used for its supply  cryogenic nitrogen in       gal transport tanks provides high quality nitrogen and utilizes equipment that is generally less expensive  liquid nitrogen is passed through the nitrogen converter  where the fluid is pumped under pressure prior to being converted to gas  the gas is then injected into the string  generally  the requirement is for the nitrogen converter and a work tank  with additional tanks being provided as necessary  for operations in excess of    hours  the requirement for liquid nitrogen could be quite large  and this can result in logistical difficulties  to move away from tank transport for large nitrogen dependent drilling operations  the use of nitrogen generators is often recommended offshore

cuttings out of the wellbore  prevention of fluid influx  and the maintenance of wellbore stability   depend on the flow of drilling fluids and the pressures associated with that flow  for example  if the wellbore pressure exceeds the fracture pressure  fluids will be lost to the formation  if the wellbore pressure falls below the pore pressure  fluids will flow into the wellbore  perhaps causing a blowout  it is clear that accurate wellbore pressure prediction is necessary  to properly engineer a drilling fluid system  it is necessary to be able to predict pressures and flows of fluids in the wellbore  the purpose of this chapter is to describe in detail the calculations necessary to predict the flow performance of various drilling fluids for the variety of operations used in drilling and completing a well    overview   drilling fluids range from relatively incompressible fluids  such as water and brines  to very compressible fluids  such as air and foam  fluid mechanics problems range from the simplicity of a static fluid to the complexity of dynamic surge pressures associated with running pipe or casing into the hole  this chapter first presents a general overview of one dimensional   d  fluid flow so that the common features of all these problems can be studied  next  each specific wellbore flow problem is examined in detail  starting from the simplest and progressing to the most complicated  these problems are considered in the following order    static incompressible fluids   static compressible fluids   circulation of incompressible fluids

solves the equations of mass  momentum  and energy for each flow stream and the energy equation for the wellbore and formation  in the usual treatment of these equations  the mass conservation equations are not stated explicitly  and the temperatures are given  rather than calculated from the energy equation  here  the whole problem is set out  with appropriate assumptions made for special  simplified cases as they are considered the flow streams are treated as  d constant area flow but with recognition of the effects of discontinuous area changes  such as nozzles  the assumption of  d flow means that the flow variables  such as density  velocity  viscosity  etc   are given as their average values over the cross sectional area of the flow stream  for instance  for flow in a tube  the frictional pressure drop is formulated in terms of the average velocity  density  and viscosity  the equations of mass and momentum conservation are solved subject to the assumption of steady flow  this assumption is that time variations of all variables are neglected in a time increment  in particular  this means that mass accumulation effects are not considered in the mass balance equation and that velocity is only a function of position in the momentum balance equation  fully dynamic momentum equations are considered in a later section the balance equations are written in a control volume form  the equations are written as integrals over a specified volume with specified surface areas rather than as partial differential equations at a point  for these flow streams  the volume under consideration has cross sectional area   a   and length     z     the surface areas are the circular or annular cross sectional areas    a    of the ends and the cylindrical lateral surface area  in the solution of these equations  only the entrance and exit values of the flow variables are calculated  to evaluate the integrals  the variation of variables between the entrance and exit of each space increment may be needed  the usual assumption used in wellbore calculations is that density  velocity  viscosity  and thermal conductivity are constant and equal to entrance conditions through the increment and that pressure and temperature vary linearly between entrance and exit  experience has shown these assumptions to be good except for compressible flow  for most cases  the increased accuracy from other interpolation methods does not justify the computation penalty  on the other hand  none of these calculations are so numerically intensive that they cannot be done with more accurate integration methods on a personal computer  and some of these methods are mentioned later in the text       single phase flow      the balance of mass for single phase flow is given

separation  injection  and pumping  a description of the technologies in each area suitable for downhole processing is provided below      gas liquid separation and injection     the most common method of separating liquid  oil or water  and gas is by density difference  because of the relatively large differences in density between liquids and gas  this separation is normally easier than oil water separation  where the densities of the phases are much closer  in a conventional vessel  the force of gravity allows liquid droplets to settle from the gas within a designed residence time  special internal vanes in the upper portion of the vessel may be used to promote droplet coalescence and improve gas quality  sometimes antifoam chemicals are required to reduce foaming  in more

           capillary pressure relationships are dimensional functions that range from large negative to large positive values   capillary pressure is often defined as the pressure of the less dense

liquid streams from a production separator or similar installation  and it is by far the most common method of sampling pressurized hydrocarbon fluids  usually  the objective of separator sampling is to obtain a fluid representative of the production of one well that enters the separator in its entirety  but the method also can be used to obtain a fluid representing commingled production from a number of wells into a single gas oil separation plant  in either case  the objective is to collect separate samples of the gas and liquid exiting the separator and to measure the separate flow rates of the two phases and obtain the gas oil ratio  gor   although the two phases are never in perfect equilibrium  providing that the two samples are representative of the separate flows  it is possible to mix the two samples together in the same proportion in which they are produced t obtain a recombined sample that represents the fluid entering the separator      errors related to surface sampling     some of the biggest errors affecting fluid samples are related to the measurement of separator gas and  liquid flow rates  which are crucial for the recombination process in the laboratory  good accuracy is often considered to be in the region of     but the figure can be much worse  for example  if there is carry over of liquid in the gas exit stream  or carry under of gas in an oil with foaming tendencies   problems are especially common for gas well production tests  where very high flow rates can be used  and special techniques are available for trying to measure liquid carry over in such situations  however  the best approach involves proper sizing and adjustment of the separator for the production rate  another important source of error in this domain involves confusion over whether liquid flow rates are reported at separator conditions or at tank conditions  this has serious implications for gas condensate fluids in which the separator liquid shrinkage is typically much larger than in the case of an oil   although broad guidelines exist concerning the volumes of samples that should be collected  special attention should be given when collecting gas samples from separators operating at low pressures because the lower density may result in the collection of insufficient weight of gas     fig       enables the required volume of gas to be estimated simply as a function of separator pressure  gor  and the volume of liquid that is required  this chart is reproduced with the kind permission of saudi aramco    file vol  page     image      png    fig        separator gas volume to be collected as a function of pressure  gor  and oil volume          separator sampling methods     in line with current trends in the oil industry  current recommendations are to use evacuated bottles for gases and piston bottles for liquids and avoid any use of mercury in sampling operations  at extremely low temperatures  piston bottles have been reported to leak past the piston seal  so sampling under such conditions should be avoided if possible  if these methods cannot be used  then repeated purging  a minimum of five times  should be used for gas samples  and the displacement of brine should be used for liquid samples unless high h s or co  levels are present  in which case it is preferable to use separator water saturated with gas if it is available  the principal guidelines to be followed for surface sampling are given in    table         file vol  page     image      png    table        the two most common separator sampling methods are described in the american petroleum institute s rp    api rp     sampling petroleum reservoir fluids  second edition        washington  dc  api    filling an evacuated container  method     filling a piston type container  method         filling an evacuated container      this method is especially simple and accurate  the principal undesirable feature of the method is the requirement that the vessel be evacuated before its transport to the sampling point  with possible loss of vacuum during transport   or that a vacuum pump be provided at the wellsite  testing pre evacuated vessels for adequate vacuum at the time of sampling should be done only by personnel well trained in vacuum testing procedures because improper testing often leads to loss of vacuum or introduction of air into the sample vessel   collecting an additional sample may be preferable to vacuum testing   a clean  evacuated container should never be purged with separator gas and re evacuated in the field because any liquid that condenses in the container during the purge may not totally re evaporate during evacuation in the field   sample collection is accomplished by the following steps    locate an appropriate sample

analysis  we mean applying analytical tools to identify  describe  quantify  and explain uncertainty and its consequences for petroleum industry projects  typically  there is money involved  always  we are trying to estimate something of value or cost  sometimes  but not always  we are trying to choose between competing courses of action   the tools we use depend on the nature of the problem we are trying to solve  often when we are choosing between competing alternatives  we turn toward decision trees  when we simply wish to quantify the risk or the uncertainty  the tool of choice is monte carlo simulation   a decision tree is a visual model consisting of nodes and branches  such as    fig        explained in detail later in this article  for now  observe that it grows from left to right  beginning with a root decision node  square  also called a choice node  the branches of which represent two or more competing options available to the decision makers  at the end of these initial branches  there is either an end node  triangle  also called a value node  or an uncertainty node  circle  also called a chance node   the end node represents a fixed value  the circle   s branches represent the possible outcomes along with their respective probabilities  which sum to       beyond these initial uncertainty nodes    branches  there may be more squares and more circles  which generally alternate until each path terminates in an end node    file vol  page     image      png    fig      simple decision tree with one choice node and one chance node          purpose of decision trees     the idea is to describe several possible paths representing deliberate actions or choices  followed by events with different chances of occurrence  the actions are within the control of the decision makers  but the events are not  by assigning probabilities and values along the way  we can evaluate each path to select an optimal path  the evaluation is simple  consisting of alternating between calculating weighted averages or expected values at each circle  then choosing the best action from each square  ultimately  we obtain a value for the root node  the solution to the decision tree consists in this pairing of root value and optimal path   the numbers at end nodes generally represent either net present value  npv  or marginal cost   the goal being to either maximize npv or minimize cost  thus  the optimal action at each square might be a maximum  for npv  or a minimum  for cost  of the various branches emanating from that square      fig       shows a simple decision tree with one choice node and one chance node  the decision tree represents a choice between a safe and a risky investment  selecting the risky alternative results in a     chance of winning     and a     chance of losing      alternatively  one can be guaranteed     we solve the decision tree by first calculating the expected value of the chance node                                   and then selecting the better of the two alternatives      vs      namely      the    correct    path is the risky investment  and its value is       some would question this logic and say that they prefer the sure thing of    to the chance of losing      a person who would prefer the guaranteed    might also prefer    or    to the risky investment  trial and error would reveal some value  say     for which that person would be indifferent between the two alternatives  that is  they would be just as happy to have    as they would to have the opportunity to flip a fair coin and get paid     if heads comes up and lose     if tails comes up  in this case  we call    the certainty equivalent of the chance  the difference between the actual expected value and the certainty equivalent  in this case                  is called the risk premium  suggesting the price you would pay to mitigate the risk  pursuing this line of reasoning leads us to the topic of utility functions clemen  r t  and reilly  t        making hard decisions with decision tools suite  boston  massachusetts  duxbury press      utility functions     suppose you are faced with a risky choice  say whether to drill a

resistivity      formation resistivity is a key parameter in determining hydrocarbon saturation  an electric current can pass through a formation because it contains water with enough dissolved ions to be conductive  with a few rare exceptions  such as metallic sulfides and graphite  dry rock matrix is a good electrical insulator  however  perfectly dry rocks seldom occur below ground level  so nearly all subsurface formations have finite  measurable resistivities because of the water in their pores  adsorbed onto their grain surfaces  or absorbed into a clay structure the resistivity of a formation depends on the resistivity of the formation water  the amount of water present  and the structure and geometry of the pores  the resistivity  specific resistance  of a substance is the

hydrocarbon bearing formations with almost no formation water can have resistivities as high as        ohm   m formation resistivities are measured either by passing a known current through the formation and measuring the electrical potential  electrode or galvanic devices  or by inducing a current distribution in the formation and measuring its magnitude  induction devices  because resistivities cannot be read accurately over the entire measurement range when displayed on a linear scale  all resistivity logs are now presented on logarithmic grids  usually in   decades across two log tracks  this allows the display of readings from     to      ohm   m  with a single curve covering the useful range of nearly all logs  a backup curve is used in the exceptional cases of readings outside that range  as resistivity data are used more and more digitally  and the log plots are mostly for reference  other formats are in wide use most wireline resistivity logging tools also have the ability to measure and record small differences in electrical potential that occur spontaneously in conductive muds as a continuous sp curve  the sp curve records the electrical potential differences generated by the interaction of formation water  conductive drilling fluid  and ion selective shales  it has a wide range of formation evaluation applications  including differentiating

referred to as formation damage  this broad definition of formation damage includes flow restrictions caused by a reduction in permeability in the near wellbore region  changes in relative permeability to the hydrocarbon phase  and unintended flow restrictions in the completion itself  flow restrictions in the tubing or those imposed by the well partially penetrating a reservoir or other aspects of the completion geometry are not included in this definition because  although they may impede flow  they either have been put in place by design to serve a specific purpose or do not show up in typical measures of formation damage such as skin over the last five decades  a great deal of attention has been paid to formation damage issues for two primary reasons      the ability to recover fluids from the reservoir is affected very strongly by the hydrocarbon permeability in the near wellbore region  and     although we do not have the ability to control reservoir rock properties and fluid properties  we have some degree of control over drilling  completion  and production operations  thus  we can make operational changes  minimize the extent of formation damage induced in and around the wellbore  and have a substantial impact on hydrocarbon production  being aware of the formation damage implications of various drilling  completion  and production operations can help in substantially reducing formation damage and enhancing the ability of the well to produce fluids on this page  we discuss methods to measure and to quantify the extent of formation damage and provide criteria that can be used to identify various types of formation damage  the goal is to define the mechanisms involved better so that an operator can recommend and design the correct remedial action and or make changes to drilling  completion  and production operations to minimize damage in the future  it is generally true that  whenever possible  preventing formation damage is more effective than remedial treatments such as acidizing and fracturing  we do not discuss such treatments in this chapter  however  for each type of damage mechanism  potential remedial treatments are suggested __toc__     quantifying formation damage     a commonly used measure of well productivity is the productivity index    j    in barrels per pounds per square inch rtenotitle

compositional aspects of the immiscible gas oil displacement process  the implications of these compositional effects are very dependent on the oil composition  the composition of the injected gas  and the surface facilities and pipelines available in a particular field situation  the injected gas oil composition interactions can be categorized as either swelling effects  gas dissolving into the oil phase  or stripping effects  various components from the oil transferring to the gas phase       swelling compositional effects     the most obvious compositional effect in the immiscible gas oil displacement process is that  if the oil is not saturated with gas at the reservoir pressure or if the reservoir pressure is increased as a result of the gas injection  the volume of gas dissolved in the oil will increase until the oil is saturated at that pressure  at the same time and because of the increased volume of gas in solution in the oil  the oil formation volume factor  fvf  will increase  this phenomenon  commonly called swelling  can increase the efficiency of the gas oil displacement process   the significance of the swelling effect is dependent on the oil reservoir situation  for an oil reservoir in which there is a gas cap  the underlying oil column will already be fully or nearly saturated with gas at the reservoir pressure  hence  there will be very little impact on the gas oil displacement process as a result of the interaction between the reservoir oil and injected gas  however  for an oil reservoir in which there is no gas cap and where the oil bubblepoint pressure is very low compared with the original reservoir pressure  the swelling effect can be a very significant part of the gas oil displacement process  the swanson river field  cook

from      to         rb stb  the application of immiscible gas injection to the swanson river field is discussed in immiscible gas injection case studies   in some of the simple calculation techniques discussed below  the swelling effect is included  in a  quot black oil quot  type of numerical reservoir simulator  the swelling effect is taken into account because  although there are only two hydrocarbon components  gas and oil  for the two hydrocarbon phases  the swelling effect is incorporated by means of the entered table of oil pressure volume temperature  pvt  properties  e g   fvf  gas in solution  oil viscosity  as a function of pressure  in other words  in this type of reservoir simulator  the gas hydrocarbon component exists either as a free gas phase or as gas dissolved in the oil  the oil hydrocarbon component exists only as part of the liquid phase  a compositional numerical reservoir simulator will automatically take the swelling phenomenon into account in its equation of state phase behavior calculations  for detailed discussion of the various types of numerical reservoir simulators and their applications  see compositional simulation of miscible processes      stripping compositional effects     the other key compositional aspect of the immiscible gas oil displacement process is the vaporizing  or stripping  by the lean injected gas of some hydrocarbon components of the oil  particularly the intermediate hydrocarbon components  c  through c    in most cases  the injected gas is very lean natural gas that is the residue gas from a nearby gas processing plant and composed primarily of methane  at such gas processing plants  the propane and heavier hydrocarbon components typically have been condensed from the entering produced gas  in some cases  ethane is also extracted from the gas  such a lean injected gas will  when in contact with the oil at reservoir conditions  vaporize various hydrocarbon components from the oil until the gas and oil phases have reached compositional equilibrium   in immiscible gas oil displacements using nitrogen  n    carbon dioxide  co    or some combination of these gases  such as flue gas      n       co    these nonhydrocarbon injected gases can also vaporize various hydrocarbon components until gas oil equilibrium is reached at reservoir conditions  this phenomenon has been observed in the hawkins nitrogen injection project  nitrogen is not as efficient as methane at stripping hydrocarbon components from the oil  carbon dioxide  because its phase behavior is much like that of propane  can vaporize a considerable amount of hydrocarbon components from the oil at reservoir conditions   the significance of the stripping effect

present in the form of droplets is the dispersed or internal phase  and the phase in which the droplets are suspended is called the continuous or external phase  for produced oilfield emulsions  one

    overview     crude oil is seldom produced alone because it generally is commingled with water  the water creates several problems and usually increases the unit cost of oil production  the produced water must be    separated from the oil  treated  disposed of properly  all these steps increase costs  furthermore  crude oil must comply with certain product specifications for sale  including the amount of basic sediment and water  bs amp w  and salt  which means that the produced water must be separated from the oil to meet crude specifications   produced water may be produced as  quot free quot  water  i e   water that will settle out fairly rapidly   and it may be produced in the form of an emulsion  a regular oilfield emulsion is a dispersion of water droplets in oil  emulsions can be difficult to treat and may cause several operational problems in wet crude handling facilities and gas oil separating plants  emulsions can create high pressure drops in flow lines  lead to an increase in demulsifier use  and sometimes cause trips or upsets in wet crude handling facilities  the problem is usually at its worst during the winter because of lower surface temperatures  these emulsions must be treated to remove the dispersed water and associated inorganic salts to meet crude specifications for transportation  storage  and export and to reduce corrosion and catalyst poisoning in downstream processing facilities   emulsions occur in almost all phases of oil production and processing  inside reservoirs  wellbores  and wellheads  at wet crude handling

is used to accomplish complete separation  a small percentage of water probably will remain in the oil  even after extended settling  the remaining water will be in minute droplets that have extremely low settling velocities  these droplets also will be widely dispersed  so that they have little chance to collide  coalesce into larger droplets  and settle   the amount of water that emulsifies with crude oil in most production systems can vary widely  ranging from  amp lt    to  amp gt     vol   in rare cases   the most common range of emulsified water in light crude oils  i e   above     api  is from   to    vol   and in crude oils that are heavier than     api is from    to    vol       types of emulsions     produced oilfield emulsions can be classified into three broad groups    water in oil  oil in water  multiple or complex emulsions  water in oil emulsions consist of water droplets in a continuous oil phase  and oil in water emulsions consist of oil droplets in a water continuous phase     figs    and      show the two basic  water in oil and oil in water  types of emulsions  in the oil industry  water in oil emulsions are more common  most produced oilfield

reservoir simulator  the simulation must be able to predict the phase behavior as well as the sweep behavior in the reservoir to forecast such quantities as incremental oil recovery  miscible solvent requirement  and solvent utilization efficiency and to optimize such variables as solvent composition  operating pressure  slug size  water alternating gas  wag  ratio  injection well placement  and injection rate   the compositional reservoir simulator calculates the flow in up to three dimensions of solvent  oil  and water phases as well as   n   components in the solvent and oil phases  it also computes the phase equilibrium of the oil and solvent phases  i e   the equilibrium compositions and relative volumes of the solvent and oil phases  in each gridblock of the simulator  in addition  it computes solvent  and oil phase densities  the equilibrium compositions and densities are calculated with an equation of state  eos   from knowledge of the phase compositions and densities  solvent and oil viscosity and other properties such as interfacial tension are estimated from correlations      predicting phase behavior     phase behavior can be predicted by    ternary and pseudoternary phase diagrams  equations of state  eos   phase behavior  from both methods  provides valuable inputs to the reservoir simulator      advantages of using a compositional simulator     a compositional simulator is the most mechanistically accurate simulator for solvent compositional processes  when the eos is tuned properly to appropriate experimental data  it computes realistic phase behavior  thus  the appropriate phase behavior for flooding with enriched hydrocarbon solvent  lean hydrocarbon solvent  n   and co  all can be taken into account  compositional simulators predict the effect of changing pressure and injection solvent composition on a displacement without the need to enter approximations into the simulator for these effects  except as the eos itself is an approximation   the compositional simulator is capable of computing realistic behavior when pressure is well below the minimum miscibility pressure  mmp  of the injection solvent  is near but still below the mmp  or is well above the mmp  for this reason  it is ideally suited to study optimum operating conditions   in addition to these advantages  a compositional simulation  to a large degree  removes the need for a user defined miscible flood residual oil saturation  as it naturally computes the amount of residual oil left after the interaction of phase behavior and dispersion and distributes this residual saturation realistically as a varying saturation instead of an input  constant saturation   a compositional simulation can have other aspects of mechanistic reality besides phase behavior  the mechanisms of molecular diffusion and convective dispersion may be included in the equations solved by the simulator  although grid refinement sensitivity  described later   or numerical dispersion  may dwarf the effects of these mechanisms in many simulations  they may be important to include in the finely gridded reference simulations  also described later    another physical mechanism that can be included in compositional simulations is the effect of interfacial tension  ift  on solvent oil relative permeability and capillary pressure  although one cannot readily foresee the impact of a particular mechanism in the complex compositional simulation of solvent flooding  inclusion of the ift mechanism seems prudent   when an appropriate relative permeability treatment is included  compositional simulation predicts realistic solvent trapping  especially the trapping of solvent by crossflowing oil  oil crossflow into a solvent swept zone immiscibly displaces the solvent in a compositional simulation and leaves the solvent as a residual saturation consistent with the phase behavior      disadvantages of using a compositional simulator     the primary disadvantages of a compositional simulator are the degree of grid refinement often required to compute oil recovery with satisfactory accuracy and the computing time required for fine grid simulations  these factors generally preclude using a compositional simulator directly for full field simulations unless some kind of scaling up technique is used to transfer the information developed from fine grid reference model simulations on a limited reservoir scale to coarse grid simulations on the full field model scale  the predicted benefit of compositionally enhanced solvent flooding can be substantially in error if the simulation is made directly with a full field model with typical coarse grids  this is illustrated by    fig        which shows the results of an enriched solvent

technology  procedures used onshore and offshore in less hostile regions  however  must be modified to meet the challenges of the harsh climatic conditions in the remote locations      overview     in the last decade  the major area of industry interest has been the offshore region of alaska and canada  the environmental conditions vary significantly in each of these regions  major factors that affect normal offshore operations are    extremely cold temperatures  fog  gusty winds  short open water season  permafrost  persistent ice  the specific production system that is selected must be tailored to each unique combination of these factors to ensure safe oilfield development      environmental conditions         sea ice      sea ice is the principal environmental factor in all of the offshore artic areas  the most abundant type of sea ice encountered offshore is less than   year old  this first year ice begins to form during fall and grows to a thickness of   to   ft during the winter  sheets of ice close to shore become landfast and remain locked in place throughout the winter  beyond the landfast zone  the ice is kept in constant motion by wind  currents and  in some areas  the influence of the arctic polar pack  this dynamic movement causes shearing impacting between ice features that produce ridges of ice several miles in length  ice ridges formed in this manner are called pressure ridges  localized ridging around a grounded ice feature  the shoreline  or a structure is considered a rubble pile  in areas of extremely cold winter temperatures  the ice blocks within a ridge or rubble pile begin to refreeze into a contiguous feature  depending on the conditions  the refrozen consolidated thickness could become several times larger than the first year ice thickness       ice islands      the other major type of ice is not formed from the seawater but is freshwater ice from the glaciers of northern canada  in the arctic ocean  the glacial fragments are called ice islands  these tabular shaped features are several thousand feet in diameter and more than     ft deep   ice usually exerts the predominant forces on arctic offshore structures  extensive laboratory and field tests have been conducted on small and large scale specimens to determine in situ strength characteristics for design  from the results of these tests  the mechanical properties of ice are predicted  they consider salinity  temperature  crystallographic structure  and loading rate   when ice is loaded at a very slow strain rate  it exhibits a plastic behavior  loaded rapidly  it behaves as a brittle material  empirical equations have been developed that relate the ice movement rate and shape of the structure or indenter to the strain in the ice feature   the shape of the structure is also a primary factor in producing a crushing  buckling  or flexural failure of the ice feature  for narrow structures relative to the ice thickness  crushing is the predominant failure mode  as the width increases  a combination of crushing and buckling of the ice field around the platform results in the development of a rubble pile  the rubble pile will then shield the structure from direct impact of subsequent ice floes and ensure failure of the ice mantle away from the production facility  sloping sided structures normally force a flexural ice failure  because ice flexural strength is    to     of the crushing strength  an appreciable reduction in ice forces can be achieved when a bending failure is induced       wave      the wave conditions in the arctic are similar to other offshore areas  and the design of structures against wave loading is well established  near shore sea states can be defined by determination of the open water area along the storm route or fetch and the water depth  in the arctic ocean  the presence of the sea ice and the polar pack limits the open water fetch for storms to generate and consequently reduces the design wave height       permafrost      permafrost is soil at a temperature below     f with partially or completely frozen pore water  drilling and production operations in areas with permafrost have been well defined from experience of the prudhoe bay field  in most near shore areas of the artic  permafrost has been found at or near the mudline  these soils are very stiff and can make excavation for pipelines or driving of piling nearly impossible  permafrost normally is soil bonded by ice and is very susceptible to change in temperature  this can result in significant changes in the soil characteristics and must be considered in the design       production structures           artificial islands       artificial islands already are used in many shallow water areas throughout the world for permanent drilling and producing facilities  the islands that are currently being used for drilling in the arctic consist of either

difficult task  especially if reliable data are available  although  if the information  especially that pertaining to the well   s capacity  is poor  the design will usually be marginal  bad data often result in a misapplied pump and costly operation  a misapplied pump may operate outside the recommended range  overload or underload the motor  or draw down the well at a rapid rate that may result in formation damage  on the other extreme  the pump may not be large enough to provide the desired production rate   too often  data from other wells in the same field or in a nearby area are

calculations at the various wellbores  provide a solid basis for a quality  d reservoir description and quantitative hydrocarbons in place and flow calculations      calculating net pay     the determination of net pay is a required input to calculate the hydrocarbon pore feet    f    hcp    at a wellbore and its input to the overall reservoir original oil in place  ooip  or original gas in

either    pay  or    nonpay   the  quot net to gross ratio quot  or  quot net gross quot   n g  is the total amount of pay footage divided by the total thickness of the reservoir interval  for simplicity  the well is assumed here to be vertical   a n g of     means that the whole of the reservoir interval is pay footage  in this formula  any foot  or half foot  that is defined as nonpay contributes absolutely nothing to the subsequent reservoir engineering ooip  or ogip  and reserves calculations  even if it contains some amount of hydrocarbons  the net pay determination should be performed in a reasonable practical manner  but it should be recognized that when any cutoff is used  the result will  to some extent  be arbitrary      conceptual bases for net pay calculations     several conceptual bases for the petrophysical calculations of net pay are described here  at one limit  the whole of the reservoir interval can be treated as net pay  i e   n g equals       another reasonable engineering approach is to define some lower limit on flow  below which each foot or half foot of the reservoir interval is deemed to be nonpay  a third approach is to use one or more log cutoffs that have been used historically within the petroleum industry  the advantages and disadvantages of these various approaches will be discussed in this section       full interval as net pay      one approach is to calculate the ooip or ogip assuming that all the reservoir interval is pay to determine the total volume of hydrocarbons present within the reservoir interval  when using an n g     approach  the technical team needs to ensure that the calculations of porosity  permeability  and   s    w   are quantitatively reasonable over the whole range of values for each of these parameters  this calculation could be called a determination of the  quot total hydrocarbon resource quot  within the reservoir interval  and it provides a value for the total hydrocarbon potential of the reservoir  some of these hydrocarbons will have low mobilities and will contribute little or nothing to hydrocarbon recovery  but  with this value available  the engineer has a measure of how well the reservoir is producing overall and what resources should be considered for improved recovery project evaluations  this value can be viewed as the ultimate  quot prize  quot   another reason for setting n g to     is that  with modern reservoir engineering tools  it is technically feasible to treat the entire reservoir interval as pay  for example  with modern reservoir engineering tools  a million  or more  cell reservoir simulation model can be constructed in which a very detailed description of the vertical and horizontal variations in the reservoir rock properties are incorporated  in this approach  the very poor quality portions of the reservoir are assigned low porosities  low permeabilities  and higher water saturation values  then  in the ooip or ogip calculations  these portions contain only small volumes of hydrocarbons and will contribute their appropriate  albeit small  share to pressure maintenance and recoverable hydrocarbons  this is in contrast to defining these poor quality intervals as nonpay and defining a priori that they contribute nothing to ooip or ogip or reserves       mobility or permeability cutoff approach      from first principle calculations using darcy   s law  a reservoir engineer can define net pay by applying a fluid flow cutoff  the choice of this cutoff would be related directly to the hydrocarbon mobility  rock permeability divided by hydrocarbon viscosity  in the different portions of the reservoir interval  with this approach  the net pay permeability cutoff used in the point by point log calculations would be quite different between that for a gas reservoir  very low gas viscosity of approximately      cp   that for a light oil reservoir  oil viscosity of   to    cp   and that for a heavy oil reservoir  oil viscosity of        cp or more   cobb  w m  and marek  f j        net pay determination for primary and waterflood depletion mechanisms

an unknown reduction in the unquantifiable  in a different context  formation damage is defined as the impairment to reservoir  reduced production  caused by wellbore fluids used during drilling completion and workover operations  it is a zone of reduced permeability within the vicinity of the wellbore  skin  as a result of foreign fluid invasion into the reservoir rock   typically  any unintended impedance to the flow of fluids into or out of a wellbore is referred to as formation damage  this broad definition includes flow restrictions caused by a reduction in permeability in the near wellbore region  changes in relative permeability to the hydrocarbon phase  and unintended flow restrictions in the completion itself  flow restrictions in the tubing or those imposed by the well partially penetrating a reservoir or other aspects of the completion geometry are not included in this definition because  although they may impede flow  they either have been put in place by design to serve a specific purpose or do not show up in typical measures of formation damage such as skin      preventing formation damage     over the last five decades  a great deal of attention has been paid to formation damage issues for two primary reasons    ability to recover fluids from the reservoir is affected very strongly by the hydrocarbon permeability in the near wellbore region  although we do not have the ability to control reservoir rock properties and fluid properties  we have some degree of control over drilling  completion  and production operations  thus  we can make operational changes  minimize the extent of formation damage induced in and around the wellbore  and have a substantial impact on hydrocarbon production  being aware of the formation damage implications of various drilling  completion  and production operations can help in substantially reducing formation damage and enhancing the ability of the well to produce fluids      formation skin damage

injection  commonly referred to as secondary oil recovery  common practice in the industry is to refer to all other methods as tertiary enhanced oil recovery  according to prats prats  m        thermal recovery  no     richardson  texas  monograph series  spe  thermal enhanced oil recovery  teor  is a family of tertiary processes defined as  quot any process in which heat is introduced intentionally into a subsurface accumulation of organic compounds for the purpose of recovering fuels through wells  quot  this article provides an introduction to the mechanisms by which steam can enhance oil recovery      steam     the most common vehicle used to inject heat is saturated steam  hot water and heated gasses have been tried  but none are as effective as quality steam  according

solid  ice   as a liquid  water   or as a gas  loosely called steam   steamflood processes are concerned with the liquid and gas phases  and the change from one phase to the other  the phase change region  in which water coexists as liquid and gas  is where our interest lies when considering steam for use in the oil field  the term  quot steam quot  is an imprecise designation because it refers to a water liquid gas system that can exist from     f to any higher temperature  from     psia to any higher pressure  and from nearly all liquid to      gas  steam quality refers to the phase change region of liquid to gas and is defined as  rtenotitle                         heat capacity is expressed in units of btu  lbm   f   a  quot btu quot  is defined as the amount of heat required to raise   lbm of water from    to     f  all liquids and solids are compared to pure water  which has the highest heat capacity of any substance at   btu  lbm   f   by calculating a ratio of the heat capacity of water divided by that of another substance  a convenient fraction called  quot specific heat quot  is obtained  notice that petroleum has a specific heat of      or half that of water  and sandstone is only     of water on a per pound basis  no other liquid or gas carries as much heat per pound as water  also  the temperature range at which this high heat carrying performance is achieved     to      f  is ideal for many processes  including steamflooding   enthalpy is a useful property defined by an arbitrary combination of other properties and is not a true form of energy  the absolute value of enthalpy is of no practical value  changes in enthalpy are extremely useful  however  and are the basis for steamflood energy calculations  the total enthalpy held by each pound of liquid water at any temperature is called sensible heat    h    f    the heat input  which produces a change of state from liquid to gas without a change of temperature  is called the  quot latent heat of evaporation quot  and is shown by   h    fv    the total heat    h    v    in each pound of      quality or saturated steam is the sum of these two    h    v       h    f       h    fv     in the phase change or  quot saturation quot  region  steam can only exist at one temperature for a given pressure regardless of quality or latent heat content  as shown in    fig         steam increases in volume as latent heat increases  as in    fig        this is a useful property in displacing oil in a steamflood process  the volume occupied by   lbm of steam at any pressure is its specific

commonly were located near salt licks that supplied salt to the population  these salt springs were often contaminated with petroleum  and many of the early efforts to acquire salt by digging wells were rewarded by finding unwanted amounts of oil and gas associated with the saline waters  in the appalachian mountains  saline water springs commonly occur along the crests of anticlines rogers  w b

existed in oil reservoirs  but his colleagues rejected his belief because most of the producing wells did not produce any water on completion  occurrences of mixtures of oil and gas with water were recognized by griswold and munn griswold  w t  and munn  m j        geology of oil and gas fields in steubenville  burgettstown and claysville quadrangles  ohio  west virginia and pennsylvania  bulletin no       series a b  department of the interior  united states geological survey  washington  dc  but they believed that there was a definite separation of the oil and water  and that oil  gas  and water mixtures did not occur in the sand before a well tapped a reservoir it was not until      that the first commercial laboratory for the analysis of rock cores was established  and the first core tested was from the bradford third sand  bradford field  mckean county  pennsylvania   the percent saturation and percent porosity of this core were plotted vs  depth to construct a graphic representation of the oil and water saturation  the soluble mineral salts that were extracted from the core led torrey to suspect that water was indigenous to the oil productive sand shortly thereafter  a test well was drilled near custer city  pennsylvania  that encountered greater than average oil saturation in the lower part of the bradford sand  this high oil saturation resulted from the action of an unsuspected flood  the existence of which was not known when the location for the test well had been selected  the upper part of the sand was not cored  toward the end of the cutting of the first core with a cable tool  core barrel oil began to come into the hole so fast that it was not necessary to add water for the cutting of the second section of the sand  therefore  the lower   ft of the bradford sand was cut with oil in a hole free from water two samples from this section were preserved in sealed containers for saturation tests  and both of them  when analyzed  had a water content of approximately     pore volume  this well made approximately    bopd and no water after being stimulated with nitroglycerine  thus  the evidence developed by the core analysis and the productivity test after completion provided a satisfactory indication of the existence of immobile water  indigenous to the bradford sand oil reservoir  which was held in its pore system and could not

of limits  differentiation  and integration permeate all of engineering mathematics    many of the mathematical tools engineers use to evaluate and predict behavior  such as vibrations  require equations that have continuously varying terms  often  there are many terms regarding the rate of change  or the rate of change of the rate of change  and so forth  with respect to some basis  for example  a velocity is the rate of change of distance with respect to time  acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity  which makes it the rate of change of the rate of change of distance with respect to time  determining the solutions to these types of equations is the basis of differential calculus    an equation with continuously varying terms is a differential equation  if only one basis is changing  then it is an ordinary differential equation  ode   however  if two or more bases are changing  then it is a partial differential equation  pde   an ode uses the notation  quot d

produced fluids to the surface or fluids to the formation  its use in wells is normally considered a good operating practice  the use of tubing permits better well control because circulating fluids can kill the well  thus  workovers are simplified and their results enhanced  flow efficiency typically is improved with the use of tubing  furthermore  tubing is required for most artificial lift installations  tubing with the use of a packer allows isolation of the casing from well fluids and deters corrosion damage of the casing  multicompletions require tubing to permit individual zone production and operation  governmental rules and regulations often require tubing in every well  permission may be obtained for omission of tubing in special cases  tubingless completions   these special completions typically are flowing wells with relatively small casing  tubing strings are generally in outside diameter  od  sizes of       to       in  but may be as large as    in  or as small as       in the proper selection  design  and installation of tubing string are critical parts of any well completion  see the chapter on inflow and outflow in this section of the handbook for more information  tubing strings must be sized correctly to enable the fluids to flow efficiently or to permit installation of effective artificial lift equipment  a tubing string that is too small causes large friction losses and limits production  it also may severely restrict the type and size of artificial lift equipment  a tubing string that is too large may cause heading and unstable flow  which results in loading up of the well and can complicate workovers  the planned tubing must easily fit inside the installed casing  when selecting the material  environmental conditions  the projected corrosivity of the well fluids  the minimum and maximum pressures and temperature  safety aspects  and cost effectiveness must be considered the tubing must be designed to meet all stresses and conditions that occur during routine operation of the well and should have an adequate margin for unusual load conditions  it must withstand the stresses caused by tension  burst  and collapse  and it must resist the corrosive action of well fluids throughout the well life  in addition  the tubing must be handled and installed so that the tubing produces the well without failure or without causing undue operating problems __toc__     oilfield tubing     the american petroleum institute  api  developed specifications  recommended practices  and bulletins for steel tubing that meet the

personnel observed the following foam characteristics    foams can be quite effective at reducing gas mobility  on the microscopic scale  the gas and liquid phases of foam flow separately through porous media with the liquid usually flowing as thin films or lamellae that are separated by gas bubbles  the pressure gradient during foam flow is proportional to the liquid flow rate  but quite independent of the gas flow rate  the macroscopic effective viscosity of foam during its flow in porous media is a function of the number and strength of the lamellae  alludes to the importance of foam texture and bubble size   foams  at times  tend to promote larger mobility reductions in high permeability porous media  as compared with lower permeability porous media  an attractive property for improving conformance and reducing channeling   foams might be good candidates for use as gas flow blocking agents  these early workers also noted that oil in porous media often tends to destabilize most aqueous foams and tends to harm oilfield foam performance  a number of the earliest oil industry proponents of the use of foam hoped that foams would eventually lead to routine    air flooding    of reservoirs  this has not come to fruition   the earliest study of foams for use during oil recovery flooding operations attempted to capitalize on the ability of numerous aqueous based foams to significantly reduce the mobility of gas flow during gas flooding and to be able to substantially improve oil recovery flood sweep efficiency when flooding with a gas  in concept  foam flooding offers an alternative to polymer flooding  that is  foams can also provide mobility control during oil recovery flooding operations  early study and development focused on foam use for mobility control purposes during oil recovery flooding projects  especially during gas flooding operations   the focus of foam development and application has changed in more recent years  two major factors have been largely responsible for promoting this change    it is unclear if foams  especially steam and natural gas foams  can be propagated distances of more than     ft in an oil reservoir because of the substantial minimum pressure gradient required for foam propagation and in view of the small pressure gradients that exist in most of the volume of matrix rock reservoirs   economics now tend to favor small volume chemical treatments  e g   gel conformance improvement treatments  over chemical based improved oil recovery flooding operations   thus  the focus of oilfield foam development and application has shifted somewhat toward the use of foams as blocking plugging agents that are part of relatively small volume treatments applied through production wells  especially

plot  the effects of boundaries appear following the middle time region  infinite acting radial flow  in a test      recognizing boundaries     recognizing the influence of boundaries can be as important as analyzing the test quantitatively  however  a problem in recognition is that many reservoir models may produce similar pressure responses  the model selected to interpret the test quantitatively must be consistent with geological and geophysical interpretations  once the proper reservoir model has been determined  test analysis may be relatively straight forward type curve matching or regression analysis using modern well test analysis software   the shapes of the diagnostic plots for a buildup test and a drawdown test are essentially identical during the early  and middle time regions for most tests  however  boundary effects can cause quite different shapes for a given reservoir model at late times in buildup and drawdown tests  this problem is augmented by the common use of  quot equivalent time quot  functions to analyze buildup tests on drawdown type curves   there are different equivalent time functions for radial flow  linear flow  and bilinear flow  as discussed in more detail in fluid flow in hydraulically fractured wells    basically  equivalent time functions apply rigorously only to situations where either the producing time and the shut in time both lie within the middle time region or  as is commonly the case  the shut in time is much less than the producing time before shut in   to further complicate matters for buildup test analysis  the shape of the derivative curve depends on how the derivative is calculated and plotted  the derivative of pressure change may be taken with respect to the logarithm of either shut in time or equivalent time  the derivative may then be plotted vs  either of these time functions  and the shape differs for each plotting function  some pressure transient test analysis software allows the user a choice in the time function used in taking the derivative and another choice in time plotting function  for other software  the time functions used are  quot hard wired  quot  the results can be bewildering      well in an infinite acting reservoir     infinite acting  radial flow reservoirs are described on this page     figs    and      show their diagnostic curves  for these plots  the derivative was taken with respect to shut in time and derivative and pressure change curves are plotted vs  shut in time  both pressure and time are in terms of dimensionless variables  wellbore storage distortion

file vol  page      image      png    fig        diagnostic plot for buildup test       notice the significant difference in the shapes of both the derivative and pressure change curves for buildup and drawdown tests  with the pressure change curves flattening for buildup tests and the derivatives moving downward with an ultimate slope of       the time at which the flattening of the pressure change curve  and corresponding downward movement of the derivative  becomes apparent is a function of the producing time before shut in  the longer the producing time  the longer the flattening is delayed and the longer the time the buildup diagnostic plot is essentially identical to the drawdown diagnostic plot      fig       is the diagnostic plot that results when the derivative is taken with respect to radial equivalent time and the time plotting function is radial equivalent time  the drawdown and buildup curves appear to be identical for all times  however  the radial equivalent time has a maximum value of the producing time before shut in  so  for the buildup plots  the curves terminate at these maximum values of the time plotting function  and all points  quot stack up quot  at these limiting values of the plotting function  our conclusion is that radial equivalent time is more satisfactory as a variable for taking the derivative and as a plotting function for an infinite acting reservoir because the shape of the diagnostic plot is the same as for a constant rate drawdown test    file vol  page      image      png    fig        diagnostic plot when derivative is taken with respect to and plotted against radial equivalent time          linear no flow boundary     when a well is near a single no flow boundary     fig        or  as a practical matter  much closer to one boundary than to any other  and when sufficient time has elapsed for the boundary to have an influence on the pressure response during the test  the characteristic diagnostic plot  as

the annulus  however  modified techniques can be used for special situations  these techniques are    cementing through pipe and casing  normal displacement technique   stage cementing  for wells with critical fracture gradients   inner string cementing through tubing  for large diameter pipe   outside or annulus cementing through tubing  for surface pipe or large casing   reverse circulation cementing  for critical formations   delayed set cementing  for critical formations and to improve placement   multiple string cementing  for small diameter tubing       cementing through pipe and casing      conductor  surface  protection  and production strings are usually cemented by the single stage method  which is performed by pumping cement slurry through the casing shoe and using top and bottom plugs  there are various types of heads for continuous cementing  as well as special adaptors for rotating or reciprocating casing       stage cementing      stage cementing is used to ensure annular fill and seal across selected intervals whenever none of the following cementing applications can be performed    continuous single stage  lead and tail  lightweight  foamed  ceramic spheres  etc         stage cementing tools       stage cementing tools  or differential valve  dv  tools  are used to cement multiple sections behind the same casing string  or to cement a critical long section in multistages  stage cementing may reduce mud contamination and lessens the possibility of high filtrate loss or formation breakdown caused by high hydrostatic pressures  which is often a cause for lost circulation   stage tools are installed at a specific point in the casing string as casing is being run into the hole  the first  or bottom  cement stage is pumped through the tool to the end of the casing and up the annulus to the calculated fill volume  height   when this stage is completed  a shutoff or bypass plug can be dropped or pumped in the casing to seal the stage tool  a free falling plug or pumpdown dart is then used to hydraulically set the stage tool and open the side ports  allowing the second cement stage  top stage  to be displaced above the tool  a closing plug is used to close the sliding sleeve over the side ports at the end of the second stage and serves as a check valve to keep the cement from u tubing above and back through the tool        displacement stage cementing       the displacement stage cementing method is used when the cement is to be placed in the entire annulus from the bottom of the casing up to or above the stage tool  the displacement method is often used in deep or deviated holes in which too much time is needed for a free falling plug to reach the tool   fluid volumes  mud  spacer  cement  must be accurately calculated and prepared on locations and densities closely measured to prevent over  or underdisplacement of the first stage    overdisplacement can result in improper opening of the tool to apply the second  upper  stage  resulting in excess pressures or job failure   underdisplacement creates a gap  void  in the cement column at the stage tool  which results in poor zonal isolation        two stage cementing       two stage cementing is the most widely used multiple stage cementing technique  however  when a cement slurry must be distributed over a long column and hole conditions will not allow circulation in one or two stages  a three stage method can be used  the same steps are involved as in the two stage methods  except that there is an additional stage  obviously  the more stages used in the application  the more complicated the job will become  although stage cementing was very popular many years ago  new foamed cement and nonfoamed ultralightweight cement technologies have successfully reduced the need for multistage cementing in many operations       inner string cementing      when large diameter pipe is cemented  tubing or drillpipe is commonly used as an inner string to place the cement  this procedure reduces the cementing time and the volume of cement required to bump the plug  the technique uses modified float shoes  guide shoes  or baffle equipment  with sealing adaptors attached to small diameter pipe  cementing through the inner string permits the use of small diameter cementing plugs  if the casing is equipped with a backpressure valve or latchdown baffle  the inner string can be disengaged and withdrawn from the casing as soon as the plug is seated  while preparations are made to drill deeper       outside or annulus cementing      a method commonly used on conductor or surface casing to bring the top of the cement to the surface consists of pumping cement through tubing or small diameter pipe run between casings or between the

mature technology  and improved knowledge about tracer behavior in the reservoir  improved tracer analysis  and reduction of pitfalls have made tracer tests reliable  many tracer compounds exist  however  the number of suitable compounds for well to well tracers is reduced considerably because of the harsh environment that exists in many reservoirs and the long testing period  radioactive tracers with a half life of less than one year are mentioned only briefly in this chapter because of their limited applicability in long term tests     tracer classification    tracers may be roughly classified as passive or active  in principle  a passive tracer blindly follows the fluid phase in which it is injected  active tracers interact with the other fluids in the system or with the rock surface  interpretation of tracer production curves must account for this  the results from the application of active tracers may give information about fluid saturation and rock surface properties  this information is especially important when enhanced oil recovery techniques that use expensive fluids such as surfactants  micellar fluids  or polymers are considered      practical applications of tracers     in the last    years  many tracer studies have been reported and even more have been carried out without being published in the open literature  wagner   pointed out six areas in which tracers could be used as a tool to improve the reservoir description    volumetric sweep  the volume of fluid injected at an injection well until breakthrough of the traced fluid at an offset producer is a measure of the volumetric sweep efficiency between that pair of wells  very small volumes injected before breakthrough  relative to the interwell pore volume  pv   would indicate the existence of an interwell open fracture  or a very thin high permeability stringer  and would give an idea of the volume of that channel  knowledge of channels is important to the sizing of remedial treatment   identification of offending injectors  problem injection wells can be identified by associating the breakthrough of a specific tracer to its point of injection  at this well  a remedial treatment to seal a channel normally would be applied   directional flow trends  when fluids are injected in a regular pattern  five spot  nine spot  line drive  etc   and the fluids injected at each well tagged with a different tracer  directional flow trends will be obvious from the repeated early tracer breakthrough at producers in a preferential direction from the injectors  where directional flow trends are prevalent  the interwell sweep efficiency often can be improved by altering the injection pattern and or the injection and withdrawal rates at selected wells   delineation of flow barriers  faults with large displacement along the fault plane and permeability pinchouts can represent barriers to the flow of fluids perpendicular to their axis  normally  such barriers are detected by bottomhole pressure buildup surveys run in nearby wells  however  the course of these barriers can be delineated further from the production well   s response  or lack of it  to traced water injection at an array of wells surrounding the producer   relative velocities of injected fluids  when different fluids are injected simultaneously  alternately  or sequentially in the same well with each fluid tagged with a different nonadsorbing tracer  the relative velocities of these fluids can be measured from the individual tracer arrival time at offset producers  for example  assume that traced solvents and traced water are injected alternately in the same well  the early arrival of one of the traced fluids at the producing well would indicate that the early arriving fluid had contacted less of the reservoir than the slower fluid  this shows a need to alter one of the fluid injection cycles to achieve more uniform sweep of the reservoir  similarly  in a micellar flood in which water is injected sequentially  the overrunning or fingering of one injected fluid through another points out the need for better fluid mobility control to achieve more uniform sweep by the various injected fluids   evaluations of sweep improvement treatments  remedial treatments to correct sweep problems can be evaluated by comparing the before and after treatment interwell volumetric sweep as determined by tracing   many companies apply tracer on a routine basis  the reservoir engineer   s problem generally is a lack of adequate information about fluid flow in the reservoir  the information obtained from tracer tests is unique  and tracer tests are a relatively cheap method to obtain this information  the information is an addendum to the general field production history and

the improved production of oil from underground reservoirs  the source of the heat  generated either in the wells or in the volume of the reservoir  is the electrical energy supplied from the surface  this energy is then transmitted to the reservoir either by cables or through metal structures that reach the reservoir  the main effect  because of the electrical heating systems used in practice in enhanced oil recovery  has been the reduction of the viscosity of heavy and extra heavy crudes and bitumens  with the corresponding increase in production  focus is centered on systems  and the models that describe their effects  that have been used for the electromagnetic heating in the production of extra heavy petroleum and bitumen  the importance of these hydrocarbons is because of the size of

is not interrupted by the application of electrical power   it seems more efficient energetically than steam stimulation  although more careful determinations of the energy gain factors should be obtained from fully instrumented field tests    it can be used in shallow wells where steam breakthrough can occur   electrical heating does not require the additional investments required for a steam distribution system because most wells with pumps already have electrical grid connections  in most cases  the level of electrical power available at the well sites is sufficient to accommodate a higher power requirement   the widespread application of electrical submersible pumps  operating at high voltages  has generalized the knowledge required for electrical cable installations in oil installations  making it a routine process   further considerations on electrical heating are    the use of electricity  generated in plants that use fossil fuels  to increase oil production may seem contradictory  but it certainly should be used if it is energetically more efficient than steam stimulation   many concentrated resistive heaters have been installed without temperature control  as the temperature increased because of gas flow  for example   the heaters failed  the required additional connections to downhole temperature detectors  metal resistances or thermocouples  complicate the installation of these heaters but their use is necessary   distributed heating has been associated with the need for isolated sections of casing and production tubing  epoxy filled fiberglass structures   which are inherently weak under regular oil field usage  additionally  water slug flow may tend to short circuit some of these systems with the corresponding failures   distributed resistance heating  although originally considered for high frequency excitations  is in fact mostly used at low frequencies  close to    hz    very few modeling studies compared the transient response of concentrated vs  distributed heaters  and certainly no field comparison of the two methods has been carried out under similar conditions    electrical heating requires a multidisciplinary approach  and many producers limit electrical engineering personnel activities to power generation and distribution  the application of electrical heating in the oil industry  if at all considered  is

in decision and risk analysis  but other tools such as optimization  options analysis  and combinations of these various tools can also be useful  this article examines the importance of data analysis and the nature and application of these other tools      data analysis     regardless of the principal tool used in risk analysis   monte carlo simulation or decision trees   empirical data may play an important role  estimating the probabilities and values for a decision tree is often done by examining historical data  similarly  the input distributions selected for a monte carlo model are easier to justify when analogous data is available to support the choices of distribution type and value of defining parameters  such as mean and standard deviation   there are two procedures we can follow when given a set of data  depending on how willing we are to make any assumptions about them  we can make no assumptions about any underlying distribution  describing the data in terms of mean  median  mode  range  quartiles or deciles  and the like  we can draw a stem and leaf diagram  a histogram and or a cumulative distribution  looking for bimodality  outliers  and other anomalies  we can assume the data is a sample from some particular population  we can calculate standard deviation and skew  we can go on to find one or a few possible distribution types and defining parameters that would be likely candidates for this population  stated tersely  we find the best fitting probability distribution for the data   the first method is straightforward  using a spreadsheet  we can invoke the functions average  median  mode  min  max  count and so on  referencing the column or row of data  or we can use the menu sequence  tools data analysis descriptive statistics  then tools data analysis histogram   the second method requires software that uses a  quot goodness of fit quot  metric to compare a fitted density function to the data s histogram  the most popular one is the chi square test  defined as            sum   d    i      y    i     where   d    i   is the difference between the   i  th data point and   y    i    the function s prediction for that point  the distribution that minimizes this sum of normalized squared errors is deemed the best fitting curve   while this process seems simple  some caution is advised  for example  bearing in mind that the density function is supposed to pass as close as possible to the data  in the sense of minimizing the value          it is obvious that the value of the chi square best fit statistic depends on the number of classes one chooses for the histogram  nevertheless  the software generally yields a few good fits for your selection   distributions that would have very similar results in a model   to avoid the dependence on number of classes  you might choose one of the two other popular fitting metrics  namely the anderson darling and the kolmogorov smirinov  neither depends on the number of histogram classes because they use numerical integration   this curve fitting   while resembling the common least squares  linear regression procedure of finding the best linear relationship   y       mx       b      differs in several respects    linear regression requires only three or four points to establish a sensible trend between   y   and   x    but density function fitting requires a dozen or so points or more to establish a histogram with a few classes and a few points per class   linear regression is intuitive  anyone can draw a fairly good line through a scatter plot  but not many people are good at sketching log normal or normal curves  and the best fitting triangles are often surprises   the subroutines to minimize the goodness of fit function         are not as simple as the familiar formula for regression  often given as an exercise in calculus ii as soon as the student knows how to take simple partial derivatives of quadratic functions   to repeat  one should use the curve fitting software with care  a few other things to note    often the best fitting curve is not one of the familiar distributions  yet there is almost always a familiar type that is nearly as good a fit   the software may require that the user specify whether to fix the left bound of the distribution at some constant such as zero to obtain a good fit of a log normal distribution  but this rules out normal curves and restricts triangles considerably   the software requires a minimum number of points to work properly  check the user manual   using the cumulative histogram and cumulative distribution for fitting always looks like a better fit than the density function and the histogram       using risk analysis to rank investments      decision trees explicitly compare two or more alternatives and choose the one having the best expected value  in monte carlo simulation  the  quot answer quot  is si

factors affecting well deliverability  as much as     of the total pressure loss in a flowing well may occur in lifting the reservoir fluid to the surface  wellbore flow performance relates to

wellbore may include flow through perforations  a screen and liner  and packers before entering the tubing for flow to the surface  the tubing may contain completion equipment that acts as flow restrictions  such as   profile nipples  sliding sleeves  subsurface flow control devices  in addition  the tubing string may be composed of multiple tubing diameters or allow for tubing annulus flow to the surface  at the surface  the fluid must pass through wellhead valves  surface chokes  and through the flowline consisting of surface piping  valves  and fittings to the surface processing equipment  the pressure drop experienced as the fluid moves from the reservoir sandface to the surface is a function of the mechanical configuration of the wellbore  the properties of the fluids  and the producing rate   relationships to estimate this pressure drop in the wellbore are based on the mechanical energy equation for flow between two points in a system as written in    eq         rtenotitle                         in this relationship     is the kinetic energy correction factor for the velocity distribution  w is the work done by the flowing fluid  and el is the irreversible energy losses in the system including the viscous or friction losses  for most practical applications  there is no work done by or on the fluid and the kinetic energy correction factor is assumed to be one  under these conditions     eq       can be rewritten in terms of the pressure change as  rtenotitle                         this relationship states that the total pressure drop is equal to the sum of the change in potential energy  elevation   the change in kinetic energy  acceleration   and the energy losses in the system  this relationship can be written in the differential form for any fluid at any pipe inclination as  rtenotitle                         methods to estimate the pressure drop in tubulars for single phase liquid  single phase vapor  and multiphase flow are based on this fundamental relationship   with    eq        the pressure drop for a particular flow rate can be estimated and plotted as a function of rate  in the typical application  the wellhead pressure is fixed and the bottomhole flowing pressure  pwf  is calculated by determining the pressure drop  this approach will yield a wellbore flow performance curve when the pressure is plotted as a function of rate as shown in    fig        in this example  the wellhead pressure is held constant  and the flowing bottomhole pressure is calculated as a function of rate  this curve is often called a tubing

cases     eq       is applicable where the friction factor  f  is a function of the reynolds number and pipe roughness  the friction factor is most commonly estimated from the moody friction factor

referred to as progressing cavity  pc  pumps  they also are called screw pumps or moineau pumps  pc pumps initially were used extensively as fluid transfer pumps in a wide range of industrial and manufacturing applications  with some attempts made to use them for the surface transfer of oilfield fluids  however  it was not until after the development of synthetic elastomers and adhesives in the late     s that pc pumps could be applied effectively in applications involving petroleum based fluids  except for several limited field trials  it was not until the late     s that a concerted effort was made to use pc pumps as a method of artificial lift for the petroleum industry  over the past two decades  with the technical contributions and persistence of many individuals and companies

worldwide currently are being produced with these systems this chapter serves as a guideline for the design and operation of the various pcp systems currently being used in various downhole

pcp system installation  automation  troubleshooting and failure  and part     design example readers are encouraged to refer to the numerous references at the end of this chapter for additional details on pc pumps and pcp systems the two key features that differentiate pcp systems from other forms of artificial lift are the downhole pc pump and the associated surface drive systems  although other major components  such as the production tubing and sucker rod strings  are found in other downhole lift systems  the design and operational requirements typically differ for pcp applications  also  many additional equipment components may be used in conjunction with pcp systems to contend with specific application conditions the basic surface driven pcp system configuration illustrated in    fig          is the most common  although electric and hydraulic downhole drive systems and various other hybrid pcp systems are also available  see alternative pcp system configurations   the downhole pc pump is a positive displacement pump that consists of two parts  a helical steel  quot rotor quot  and a  quot stator quot  comprised of a steel tubular housing with a bonded elastomeric sleeve formed with a multiple internal helix matched suitably to the rotor configuration  the stator is typically run into the well on the bottom of the production tubing  while the rotor is connected

various companies to improve pumping capacity  performance  and serviceability for certain applications      examples of nonstandard pcp systems     these nonstanard pcp systems includes a number of different downhole drive systems that inherently eliminate tubing wear problems and reduce fluid flow losses  rod insert pc pump designs are available that preclude the need to pull the tubing string for pump replacement  charge pumps and fluidizer pumps are currently being used to increase the gas  and solids handling capabilities of pcp systems  the following sections provide a brief description of the rationale for developing each hybrid system and a description of the basic operating principles of the product where applicable       electric downhole drive pcp systems      the use of pc pumps driven by conventional electric submersible pump  esp  motors was first attempted by a canadian operator in a heavy oil well in       unfortunately with little success  and then to a much greater extent by russian operators in the     s  however  only within the last decade have these downhole drive  dhd  pcp systems been more fully developed and successfully deployed on a commercial basis delpassand  m s        high volume down hole progressing cavity pumps in viscous applications with electric submersible motors  paper    presented at the      gulf coast section esp workshop  houston  april  several major esp vendors now market motors  gear boxes  and other equipment for dhd pcp systems  as a result  these systems have begun to see wider use  the entire surface unit drive system and rod string required in a conventional pcp system are replaced with a dhd unit that typically consists of    an esp motor  either a    or   pole design that has synchronous speeds of       and       rpm  respectively   a gearbox and flex shaft assembly  a pump intake unit     fig       shows a schematic of a generic dhd system   file vol  page     image      png    fig      schematic of a downhole drive pcp system       a key feature of the dhd systems is the gearbox seal flex shaft assembly  although various vendors use different designs and configurations for these components  the overall functions are typically the same    to isolate the motor oil from the well fluids  to provide a speed reduction between the motor and the pump  to isolate the motor and gearbox from the pump   s eccentric motion  to support the thrust load generated by the pump  to provide a path for the produced fluid to flow from the wellbore past the motor  i e   for cooling  to the pump inlet  the speed reduction is necessary because    and   pole esp motors normally rotate at       and       rpm  respectively  i e   synchronous speed at    hz   which is much higher than the ideal operating speed for pc pumps  the eccentric motion of the pump is typically absorbed by a specially designed flex shaft or knuckle joint assembly positioned between the pump and the gear box   dhd systems offer certain advantages in applications in which neither an esp nor a rod driven pcp can be used optimally  for example  pc pumps generally perform better than conventional esps in viscous oil  high sand cut  or high gor applications  in deviated or horizontal wells  the rod strings required in surface driven pcp systems create potential for severe wear or fatigue problems  particularly if there is a large differential pressure on the pump  in such cases  a dhd system may offer a better overall solution by combining the pumping capabilities of a pc pump with the benefits of a rodless drive system  eliminating sucker rods also results in lower flow losses  which may allow less expensive  smaller diameter production tubing to be used  in addition  there are no backspin safety issues because the rotating parts are all run downhole  a dhd system also eliminates the need for a stuffing box at surface  thereby reducing the potential for leaks  drawbacks of the dhd systems include    the additional capital and servicing costs associated with the power cable for the downhole motor  some size restrictions  additional coordination between the esp and pcp vendors for equipment design  supply  installation  and service in most cases   in practice  these systems are normally used only in higher rate applications because their use in low productivity wells generally is not economical   it is imperative to design a dhd system properly because changing equipment once the system has been installed in a well is costly  once installed  speed control can be achieved only with a variable frequency drive  it is important to ensure that the cable and seal systems chosen are compatible with the well fluids to prevent premature system failure  also  the pump is not normally    sumped    because there must be liquid flow past the motor at all times during operation to ensure that the motor is adequately

bottomhole segment of directional and horizontal wells  optimization of a progressive cavity pump  pcp  system design for such applications begins with the drilling program  the proposed well geometry

fatigue problems  the preferred pump seating location for achieving optimal production rates throughout the well life  and possible issues related to gas and solids production      overview     the first line of defense against rod tubing wear and sucker rod fatigue problems in deviated and horizontal wells is a good wellbore profile  see previous sections on rod string tubing wear and rod loading   ideally  the planned angle build rates should be kept as low as practical  and additional monitoring is typically required during drilling to ensure that the well closely follows the prescribed path  note that slant wells  wells spud at an angle on surface   which typically have no planned curvature  often provide a good alternative to deviated wells for shallow reservoir developments as a means to avoid rod tubing wear problems  with slant wells  it is important to ensure that the well profile remains straight and does not    drop down    into the target bottomhole location  if it is not possible to avoid high wellbore curvature   gt         m          ft   in directional or horizontal wells  it becomes even more important to obtain the smoothest wellbore

and can typically be justified from an overall capital  and operating cost perspective  closely stationed directional surveys are also helpful in determining rod centralization requirements at a later stage  caution should be exercised when specifying rod strings for directional and horizontal wells  i e   where the pump is seated in the build section  based on directional surveys with long survey intervals   amp gt     m      ft   because the survey data may not reveal high curvature segments that exist in the actual wellbore  this is illustrated in    fig        which compares the dogleg severity established along a directional well based on the widely stationed openhole survey data recorded during drilling and a subsequent closely stationed gyro survey run in the cased wellbore  the gyro survey depicts significant variations and much higher curvatures  therefore  if unexpected wear problems occur repeatedly at one or more locations along a directional or slant well  the survey may have provided a poor representation of the actual well curvature  and appropriate wear mitigation strategies must be taken to prevent additional failures    file vol  page     image      png

however  attention is required when the pump seating interval is selected to avoid potential wear  pump inflow  and gas interference problems  this is illustrated by    fig        which presents a vertical section plot of a horizontal well that was inadvertently drilled with a    trap    at the base of the build section  because the severe sand plugging and gas slugging problems that occurred with the pump initially seated within the angle build section led to several workovers  the operator was forced to try seating the pump in the horizontal section beyond the trap at the location shown  although the equipment options were quite limited and wear problems were still a concern for this well  it was successfully pumped in this configuration through the use of a continuous rod string and

possible in directional and horizontal wells to maximize intake pressures  as mentioned  use of long  small diameter tail joints should be avoided as a means to lower the intake position because of the inherent pressure losses  depending on casing size  reducing the wellbore curvature over the planned pump seating interval may be important t

intentionally designed to be lower than the pressure of the formations that are being drilled  the hydrostatic head of the fluid may naturally be less than the formation pressure  or it can be induced by adding different substances to the liquid phase of the drilling fluid  such as    natural gas  nitrogen  air  whether the underbalanced status is induced or natural  the result may be an influx of formation fluids that must be circulated from the well  and controlled at surface      characteristics of ubd     the effective downhole circulating pressure of the drilling fluid is equal to the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column  plus associated friction pressures  plus any pressure applied on surface   rtenotitle  conventionally  wells are drilled overbalanced  in these wells  a column of fluid of a certain density in the hole provides the primary well control mechanism  the pressure on the bottom of the well will always be designed to be higher than the pressure in the formation     fig   a      in underbalanced drilled wells  a lighter fluid replaces the fluid column  and the pressure on the bottom of the well is designed intentionally to be lower than the pressure

pressures in underbalanced drilling       because the fluid no longer acts as the primary well control mechanism  the primary well control in ubd arises from three different mechanisms    hydrostatic pressure  passive  of materials in the wellbore because of the density of the fluid used  mud  and the density contribution of any drilled cuttings   friction pressure  dynamic  from fluid movement because of circulating friction of the fluid used   choke pressure  confining or active   which arises because of the pipe being sealed at surface  resulting in a positive pressure at surface   flow from any porous and permeable zones is likely to result when drilling underbalanced  this inflow of formation fluids must be controlled  and any hydrocarbon fluids must be handled safely at surface   the lower hydrostatic head avoids the buildup of filter cake on the formation as well as the invasion of mud and drilling solids into the formation  this helps to improve productivity of the well and reduce related drilling problems   ubd produces an influx of formation fluids that must be controlled to avoid well control problems  this is one of the main differences from conventional drilling  in conventional drilling  pressure control is the main well control principle  while in ubd  flow control is the main well control principle  in ubd  the fluids from the well are returned to a closed system at surface to control the well  with the well flowing  the blowout preventer  bop  system is kept closed while drilling  whereas  in conventional overbalanced operations  drilling fluids are returned to an open system with the bops open to atmosphere     fig         secondary well control is still provided by the bops  as is the case with conventional drilling operations    file devol

drilling may be undertaken in formations that would produce h s  or would cause other issues  if hydrocarbons were produced to surface      reasons to consider underbalanced drilling     the reasons for ubd can be broken down into two main categories    maximizing hydrocarbon recovery   minimizing pressure related drilling problems   there are also specific advantages and disadvantages of performing a drilling operation underbalanced  these are summarized in    table         file devol      final page     image      png    table   advantages vs  disadvantages of ubd         maximizing hydrocarbon recovery     there is no invasion of solids or mud filtrate into the reservoir formation  this often eliminates the requirement for any well cleanup after drilling is completed       early

required export lines are not available       reduced stimulation      because there is no filtrate or solids invasion in an underbalanced drilled reservoir  the need for reservoir stimulation  such

from simple changes in operating practices to expensive completions  such as sand consolidation or gravel packing  the sand control method selected depends on site specific conditions  operating practices and economic considerations  this page introduces the available approaches to sand control      available techniques     some of the sand control techniques available are   maintenance and workover  rate exclusion  selective completion practices  plastic consolidation  high energy resin placement  resin coated gravel  stand alone slotted liners or screens  gravel packing     maintenance and workover     maintenance and workover is a passive approach to sand control  this method basically involves tolerating the sand production and dealing with its effects  if and when necessary  such an approach requires bailing  washing  and cleaning of surface facilities routinely to maintain well productivity  it can be successful in specific formations and operating environments  the maintenance and workover method is primarily used where there is    minimal sand production  low production rates  economically viable well service     rate restriction     restricting the well   s flow rate to a level that reduces sand production is a method used occasionally  the point of the procedure is to sequentially reduce or increase the flow rate until an acceptable value of sand production is achieved  the object of this technique is to attempt to establish the maximum sand free flow rate  it is a trial and error method that may have to be repeated as the reservoir pressure  flow rate  and water cut change  the problem with rate restriction is that the maximum flow rate required to establish and maintain sand free production is generally less than the flow potential of the well  compared to the maximum rate  this may represent a significant loss in productivity and revenue      selective completion practices     the goal of this technique is to produce only from sections of the reservoir that are capable of withstanding the anticipated drawdown  perforating only the higher compressive strength sections of the formation allows higher drawdown  the high compressive strength sections will likely have the most cementation and  unfortunately  the lowest permeability  while this approach might eliminate the sand production  it is flawed because the most valuable reserves will not be in communication with the well      plastic consolidation     plastic consolidation involves the injection of plastic resins that are attached to the formation sand grains  the resin subsequently hardens and forms a consolidated mass  binding the sand grains together at their contact points  if successful  the increase in formation compressive strength will be sufficient to withstand the drag forces while producing at the desired rates  the goal of these treatments is to consolidate about a   ft radius around the well without appreciably decreasing the permeability of the rock   three types of resins are commercially available    epoxies  furans  including furan phenolic blends   phenolics  the resins are in a liquid form when they enter the formation  and a catalyst or curing agent is required for hardening  some catalysts are    internal    because they are mixed into the resin solution at the surface and require time and or temperature to harden the resin  other catalysts are    external    and are injected after the resin is in place  the internal catalysts have the advantage of positive placement because all resin will be in contact with the catalyst required for efficient curing  a disadvantage associated with internal catalysts is the possibility of premature hardening in the work string  the amounts of both resin and catalyst must be carefully chosen and controlled for the specific well conditions  epoxy and phenolics can be placed with either internal or external catalysts  however  the rapid curing times of the furans  and furan phenolic blends  require that external catalysts be used   there are two types of plastic consolidation systems       phase separation    systems     overflush    systems  phase separation systems contain only    to     active resin in an otherwise inert solution  the resin is preferentially attracted to the sand grains  leaving the inert portion that will not otherwise affect the pore spaces  these systems use an internal catalyst  accurate control of the plastic placement is critical because overdisplacement will result in unconsolidated sand in the critical near wellbore area   phase separation consolidation may be ineffective in formations that contain more than     clays  clays  which also attract the resin  have extremely high surface area in comparison to sands  the clays will attract more resin and because phase separation systems contain only a small percentage of resin  there may not be enough res

factor and well completion efficiency  this is insufficient alone for formation damage diagnosis  well performance analysis has provided a beneficial tool to identify the location and thickness of

fig      ultrasonic gas flowmeter  courtesy of daniel industries        usms derive the volume flow of the gas by measuring the transit times of high frequency sound waves  transit times are measured for pulses propagating up and downstream across the gas stream at an angle with respect to the pipe axis  these transit times  together with the meter geometry  are used to calculate the average gas velocity on a particular chord  multiple paths are used within ultrasonic meters to maximize accuracy in the overall average velocity measurement  these multiple paths also provide a certain degree of immunity to flow profile effects  such as asymmetry and swirl  the level of immunity offered by the multipath usm varies from one design to another  as shown by grimley  grimley  t        ultrasonic meter installation configuration testing  paper presented at the      aga operations conference  denver        may  despite the fact that the usm offers some immunity to flow profile distortions  they still require upstream straight lengths of pipe  a typical meter tube layout for a usm is shown in    fig          file vol  page     image      png    fig      gas ultrasonic flowmeter tube  courtesy

of each transducer pair  characterize the ultrasonic flowmeter  the transit time for a signal  traveling with the flow  is less than that for a signal traveling against the flow  the difference in these times determines flow velocity    file vol  page     image      png    fig      gas ultrasonic flowmeter measurement diagram  courtesy of daniel industries        it is also important to consider any additional uncertainty associated with the through life stability of the usm  there are several influencing factors  one of which is wall roughness  it has been shown by zankerzanker  k        the effects of reynolds number  wall roughness and profile asymmetry on single and multipath ultrasonic meters  paper presented at the      north sea flow measurement workshop  gardermoen  norway          october  that changes in wall roughness can cause significant drift in usm meters that incorporate a center path bouncing configuration to determine gas velocity  with such chord configurations  the usm measures the velocity at the center of the pipe  i e   the maximum velocity   to arrive at an average velocity  a correction factor based on the reynolds number and wall roughness is used  over time  the wall roughness changes  so the correction factor becomes more and more erroneous  this results in serious meter drift  this is just one influencing factor   to quantify all influences relies on a significant passing of time together with data gathering  so responsibility has to be placed on the manu

blocking drillstrings  and collapsing casing and drilling annuli  there are less obvious but very important safety hazards for removing hydrate plugs from flow channels  frequently  improper removal of hydrate plugs results in damage to equipment and threats to safety of personnel      safety issues     hydrates cause safety problems for two reasons  both of which are shown schematically in    figs     a and    b        upon removal  when hydrate plugs are depressurized improperly  with large pressure gradients across the plug  hydrate projectiles frequently erupt from pipes  when hydrates are heated  large confined pressure increases cause pipe ruptures king  r  et al        capp guidelines for the prevention and safe handling of hydrates  calgary  canada  canadian assn  of petroleum producers   the most common way to remove a hydrate plug from a flow channel is by depressurization  flow is stopped  and the line is slowly depressurized from both ends of the plug  at atmospheric pressure  the hydrate stability temperature is invariably less than that of the surroundings  so heat flows from the environment into the hydrate plug  the plug melts radially inward  detaching first at the pipe wall   any pressure gradient across the detached plug causes it to act like a projectile  as shown in    fig     a     king  r  et al        capp guidelines for the prevention and safe handling of hydrates  calgary  canada  canadian assn  of petroleum producers  amp nbsp with measured plug velocities up to     miles hr for short distances  the hydrate has the density of ice  almost twice that of the surrounding fluid  so at the line velocity  the plug momentum is twice that of the surrounding fluids  when the hydrate projectile encounters an obstruction or change in flow direction  such as a pipe elbow  bend  or valve  the resulting impact or pressure increase frequently causes line rupture  equipment damage  fire  and potential injury or loss of life    file vol

hydrates dissociate rapidly upon heating  and large pressure increases cause pipe ruptures            example    a common plug removal hazard      a siberian incident  in february       illustrates the second common plug removal hazard  shown in    fig     b     a pipe fitter was attempting to remove a hydrate plug by heating an exposed pipeline with a torch  the gas pressure from a dissociated mid hydrate plug rose rapidly  perhaps being confined by the plug ends  the pipeline exploded  and  in the resulting fire  one man died  four others were badly injured      safely removing hydrate plugs     hydrate plug dissociation should always be done slowly and with great care  rules of thumb for safe hydrate plug removal may be summarized as    always assume multiple hydrate plugs  there may be pressure between the plugs   attempting to move hydrate  or ice  plugs can cause ruptures in pipes and vessels   while heating a plug is not normally an option for a buried or submerged pipeline  heating should always be done with great care from the ends of the plug  heating should be done only with assurance that the plug ends will not contain the pressure   depressurizing a plug gradually from both ends is recommended as a safer alternative to single sided depressurization  however  it may be impossible to depressurize from both sides  as when only one plug end is accessible or when a very long time is are required to depressurize a large upstream volume  in such cases  very careful single sided dissociation may be done by experienced personnel      removal recommendations     there are several recommendations regarding hydrate plug removal  for example     monitor the system from early hydrate warnings  such as slush in pigging returns  changes in water rates and fluid compositions at the separator  pressure drop increases  and acoustic signals  pinging  of hydrates hitting the pipelines  before the line plugs inject methanol or glycol to prevent full flow blockage   pigging partially plugged lines and backpressuring plugged lines should be used with care because plug compaction or    snowplow    accumulation may occur   locate the hydrate plug midpoint through pressure cycles  monitoring the rate of change of upstream pressures upon reduction or increase of the downstream pressure king  r  et al        capp guidelines for the prevention and safe handling of hydrates  calgary  canada  canadian assn  of petroleum producers   slow depressurization from both sides of hydrate plugs is the preferred method of removal  one sided depressurization should be done very slowly and cautiously and  then  only if two sided depressurization is not an option  in some cases  the flu

drilling underbalanced      gaseous fluids    gaseous fluids are  basically  gas systems  in initial ubd operations  air was used for drilling  today  air drilling  or dusting  is still applied in hard rock drilling  and in the drilling of water wells  the use of air in hydrocarbon bearing formations is not recommended  because the combination of oxygen and natural gas may cause an explosive mixture  there have been a number of reported cases in which downhole fires have destroyed drillstrings  with the obvious potential consequences of the rig burning down if the mixture gets to surface    often  nitrogen is used if hydrocarbon reservoirs are drilled with a gas  for remote or offshore locations  a nitrogen generation system can be used to reduce the logistics  another option might be the use of natural gas  which  if available  has sometimes proved a worthy alternative in drilling operations  if a gas reservoir is being drilled underbalanced  a producing well or the export pipeline may produce sufficient gas at the right pressure to drill    gas drilling has advantages and disadvantages       advantages       fast penetration rates     longer bit life     greater

ingress     relies on annular velocity to remove cuttings from the well      mist systems    if a formation starts to produce small amounts of water when drilling with a gas system  the system is often changed to a mist system  the fluid added to the gas environment disperses into fine droplets  and forms a mist system that may be used for drilling  in general  this technique must be used in areas where some formation water exists  which prevents the use of complete    dry air    drilling  mist drilling is similar to gas drilling  but with the addition of liquid  and has the following characteristics      it relies on annular velocity to remove cuttings from the well     it reduces formation of mud rings     it requires high volumes     to     more than dry gas drilling      its pressures are generally higher than dry gas drilling     incorrect gas liquid ratio leads to slugging with attendant pressure increase      foam systems    drilling with stable foam has some appeal  because foam has some attractive qualities and properties at the very low hydrostatic densities that can be generated with foam systems  foam has good rheology and excellent cuttings transport properties  stable foam has some natural inherent viscosity  as well as fluid loss control properties  making it a very attractive drilling medium    during foam drilling  the volumes of liquid and gas injected into the well are carefully controlled  this ensures that foam forms when the liquid enters the gas stream at the surface  the drillin

their definition  petrophysics is the study of the physical and chemical properties of rocks and their contained fluids  it emphasizes those properties relating to the pore system and its fluid distribution and flow characteristics  these properties and their relationships are used to identify and evaluate hydrocarbon reservoirs  hydrocarbon sources  seals  and aquifers the petrophysicist or petrophysical engineer practices the science of petrophysics as a member of the reservoir management team  rmt    see the chapter on reservoir management in this section of the   handbook     the petrophysicist provides answer products needed and used by team members  as well as physical and chemical insights needed by other teammates  the reservoir and fluid characteristics to be determined are thickness  bed boundaries   lithology  rock type   porosity  fluid saturations and pressures  fluid identification and characterization  permeability  absolute   and fractional flow  oil  gas  water  it is easy to define these characteristics and to appreciate their part in the assessment of reserves  the difficult part comes in determining their actual value at a level of certainty needed to make economic decisions leading to development and production  the seven characteristics listed are interdependent  i e   to properly determine porosity from a wireline log  one must know the lithology  fluid saturations  and fluid types   the science of petrophysics is then used to unscramble the hidden world of rock and fluid properties in reservoirs from just below the earth   s surface to ones more than four miles deep  the petrophysicist then takes on many characteristics of the fictional sleuth sherlock holmes to extrapolate  from the most meager of clues  the true picture of the subsurface reservoir using dogged determination to wrest all possible information from the available data  all the while enjoying the thrill of the hunt how does the petrophysicist solve this

petrofacies  wherein we identify pore type  pore size distribution  pore throat type  and pore throat distribution  when coupled with fluid type  one can establish a capillary pressure model that will lead to understanding in situ fluid saturations and fluid flow  the discussion of the process is lengthy and is covered here and throughout the   handbook    however  the tools available to the

 these chapters explain how to make the necessary measurements and how to ensure that the resulting data are accurate enough  we will now demonstrate how to choose the appropriate tools to determine the required reservoir and fluid characteristics       choosing tools      the choices of tools for the evaluation program are usually made by the rmt with recommendations from the petrophysicist

select and prepare the sampling equipment  this article discusses those aspects of establishing a fluid sampling program      well conditioning     the best way to prepare a well for sampling is dependent on the reservoir fluid type  as indicated earlier  with the exception of one phase gas reservoirs  prolonged production will cause all reservoirs to reach saturation conditions  thus bringing about changes in the fluid composition throughout the reservoir  when this happens  there is no longer any possibility of obtaining truly representative fluid samples  thus  although in one phase gas reservoirs  and for a certain length of time in undersaturated reservoirs   the fluid will remain unchanged during pressure depletion   the true nature of the fluid will be unknown until samples actually have been analyzed in a laboratory   it is strongly recommended to take samples at the earliest opportunity in the life of a well   both in openhole and in cased hole completions  the best depth or production interval for sampling will be as far away as possible from gas oil  gas water  and oil water transition zones to reduce the chances of coning  every attempt should be made to test zones individually because commingled production may be difficult to detect and is impossible to correct in the laboratory   the possible influence of any matrix treatment chemicals on sampling programs should be evaluated  and treatment schedules should be modified accordingly  problems such as the liberation of carbon dioxide  co   or h s after acid treatments are possible  as is the release of other components such as metal ions  and these could affect analyses  on the other hand  sampling after an acid treatment has been properly cleaned up has the probable advantage of reduced drawdown in the near wellbore region   because of the enormous variety of constraints  there can be no definitive guidelines for well conditioning  the first phase of conditioning involves the cleanup  in which the well is flowed to the surface to remove any solids resulting from perforating activities  drilling mud or completion fluids in the well  and mud filtrate or workover fluids that may remain in the formation near the wellbore  here  the production rate must provide a sufficient flow velocity in the production string to lift solids  hydrocarbon liquids  and water to the surface  but conditioning is typically performed at the maximum rate  as this reduces the total length of the cleanup period   the cleanup period typically lasts from a few hours to    hours  and progress is monitored by regular measurements of flowing wellhead pressure  basic sediment and water  bs amp w   and other parameters  at the end of the cleanup period  production may be diverted through the separator to check its operation  this is an ideal moment to take backup samples      conditioning procedures     depending on the fluid type  significant differences can exist in conditioning procedures  which attempt to control or eliminate any modified reservoir fluid so that fluid entering the well is identical to that in the reservoir  for an unknown fluid  one of the most important considerations is the need to interpret the response of the well to different flow conditions and then develop the final sampling program during the test itself on the basis of this information  if initial production indicates an oil  the best approach is to evaluate the response of surface gas oil ratio  gor  to changes in production rate  as long as representative reservoir fluid enters the wellbore and is carried to the surface  and the same separator operating conditions of temperature and pressure are maintained  the gor should remain stable for different choke sizes  a gor that changes significantly between choke sizes is indicative of nonrepresentative production either caused by two phase flow effects in the near wellbore region or possibly by commingled production of more than one reservoir fluid  e g   oil zone and gas cap   and production should be choked back until gor no longer changes with choke size   if  however the reservoir contains a saturated gas condensate  extra flow periods will simply compound the condensate buildup problem  so sampling at the earliest stable rate is probably advisable  in fact  some modeling workmccain  w d  jr  and alexander  r a        sampling gas condensate wells  spe res eng                 spe       pa   has shown that when an important ring or bank of condensate has built up in the reservoir  it may be possible to produce at reasonably high rates with an apparently stable gor while producing fluid that is not representative of the original reservoir fluid  at very high flow rates  the gor may appear to increase as a result of liquid carry over in the separator gas stream       gas wells      gas wells that have a small flow velocity will exhibi

many completion engineers and research projects  there are a number of analytical techniques and guidelines to assist in determining if sand control is necessary  but no technique has proven to be universally acceptable or completely accurate  in some geographic regions  guidelines and rules of thumb apply that have little validity in other areas of the world  predicting whether a formation will or will not produce sand is not an exact science  and more refinement is needed  until better prediction techniques are available  the best way of determining the need for sand control in a particular well is to perform an extended production test with a conventional completion and observe whether sand production occurs  normally  it is not necessary to predict sand production on a well by well basis because wells in the same reservoir tend to behave similarly  the prediction required is on a reservoir by reservoir basis  however  initial good results may prove misleading  as reservoir and flow conditions change      operational and economic influences   the difficulty of determining whether sand control is required in a given well is compounded when the well is drilled in a remote area where there is no producing experience and where the various reservoir factors are slightly different from previously exploited regions  even if the reservoir and formation properties are almost identical to other developments  the operating conditions and risks may be such that different strategies apply  one example might be a subsea project  as opposed to a land development project  here  the consequences and risks associated with sand production are significantly different because of differing costs and risks associated with remedial well operations  hence  the decision to use a sand control technique is both an economic and operational decision that must be made with limited data    the decision is complicated by the fact that sand control techniques  such as gravel packing  are expensive and can restrict well productivity if not performed properly  therefore  gravel packing cannot be applied indiscriminately when the possibility for sand production from a well is unknown  making the decision whether to gravel pack is fairly easy if the formation material is either hard  no sand production  or weak  sand production   the difficulty arises when the strength of the formation material is marginal  at that point  the decision normally ceases to be primarily a technical issue but more of an economic and risk management exercise  if there is uncertainty  the conservative approach is to always apply sand control completions  this obviously will solve the sand production problem but will also increase costs and may reduce well productivity  if sand control was actually unnecessary  the implementation of sand control completions was a bad economic decision      formation strength   the procedure followed by most  to consider whether sand control is required  is to determine the hardness of the formation rock  i e   the rock   s compressive strength   because the rock   s compressive strength has the same units as the pressure difference between the reservoir and the well  the drawdown   the two parameters can be directly compared  and drawdown limits for specific wells can be determined  research performed in the early     s showed that rock failed and began to produce sand when the drawdown pressure was more than about     times the compressive strength  as an example  formation sand with a compressive strength of       psi would not fail or begin to produce sand until the drawdown exceeded       psi  others use brinnell hardness as an indicator of whether to apply sand control  the brinnell hardness of the rock is related to the compressive strength but is not as convenient to use because the units of hardness are dimensionless and cannot be related to drawdown as easily as compressive strength     sonic log   the sonic log can be used as a way of addressing the sand production potential of wells  the sonic log records the time required for sound waves to travel through the formation  usually in microseconds  the porosity is related to formation strength and the sonic travel time  short travel times  less than    microseconds  indicate low porosity and hard  dense rock  long travel times     microseconds or greater  are associated with soft  low density  high porosity rock  a common technique used for determining whether sand control is required in a given geologic area is to correlate incidences of sand production with the sonic log readings above and below the sand production that has been observed  this establishes a quick screening method for the need for sand control  the use of this method requires calibration against particular geologic formations to be reliable      formation properties log   certain well logs  s

characteristics   expected production volumes   water depth   distance from surface facilities   capacity of surface facilities  how these and related factors affect subsea processing design are discussed below     reservoir characterization    the value of subsea processing is determined primarily by reservoir characteristics and water depth  well productivity index  barrel per psi drawdown or pi   which is a function of reservoir permeability  is one of the keys  a high pi will leverage the reduced backpressure provided by subsea processing to higher production rates  this can have enormous economic implications for low pressure reservoirs in deep water  with depletion drive type reservoirs  the benefit will increase with time as reservoir pressure declines  increasing water production will make the pressure boosting effects of subsea processing more dramatic  for reservoirs without competent source rocks  good completion design is imperative to take advantage of the greater pressure drawdown opportunity  if the well is choked back to avoid excessive sand production or formation damage  the full potential of subsea processing will not be realized  because subsea processing can only impact the fluid column from the seabed to the surface  shallow reservoirs in deep water play to its strength  this is illustrated by    fig       for a typical depletion reservoir     file vol  page     image      png    fig      incremental recovery factor for subsea separation       as depicted in    fig        the incremental recovery factor for subsea separation decreases with reservoir depth  pressure boosting is most efficient when applied at the source  as reservoir depth increases and or water depth decreases  downhole processing is more beneficial      water depth and tieback distance    the benefits of subsea processing increase with water depth and tieback distance  however  they also present greater technological challenges  water depth has the greatest impact on liquid pumping  because the separated oil must be pumped to the surface  the subsea pump must be able to generate high enough pressures to overcome the hydrostatic head of the liquid column and the flow induced friction in the pipeline  in most applications  this would require multistaged centrifugal pumps operating at the low end of their flow range  the high head  low flow requirements narrow the operating range of the available subsea pumps  making pump selection difficult  although for most fluids the liquid pumping energy requirement is much less than that of gas compression  it is still a challenge to supply subsea  given the state of the technology  electric motors or hydraulic turbines may be used to drive the pump  however  both types of systems have limitations    until the challenges associated with subsea gas compression can be solved  gas must be piped to the host platform under natural pressure  given the low specific gravity of gas  water depth  which impacts pressure drop because of fluid head  should not be an issue  however  long distance tieback can be a challenge  subsea processing provides greatest benefit at low seabed separator pressure  so the gas pipeline must be sized for minimum pressure drop  that usually means larger diameter  and thus higher cost  gas leaving the separator on its way to the pipeline is at its hydrocarbon and water dewpoints  it is important for pipeline hydraulic performance that heat exchange with the seawater environment and gas phase equilibrium be carefully balanced to avoid excessive liquid condensation in the pipeline      separation philosophy    subsea processing can range from simple two phase separation to a complex gas oil water separation for individual phase transport and or disposal  the choice depends on what one is trying to achieve with the system  how difficult the fluids are to separate  expected value to be gained by the project  and risk tolerance  separation philosophy will drive the system design and ultimately the success of the project  the state of the art should be carefully considered at the time of decision  subsea technologies are advancing rapidly  what was once deemed high risk  i e   subsea well systems  is common practice today  all forms of subsea separation may well be at that mature state by the time they are needed      capacity of topside facilities    a driving force for subsea processing is the lack of topside capacity at existing host platforms and high cost for facility expansions  because of fluid slugging potentials  direct tieback using multiphase flow pipelines may require unacceptably large slug catchers  space may not be available for the additional phase separation and water treating facilities  with partial or full processing on the seabed  the need for topside facilities may be significantly reduced  availability and cost of topside capacity may influe

producing interval or the subzone with the best   kh          value  insufficient data exist to claim one approach is superior to the other  the author favors perforating in the lower part of the reservoir  retaining the flexibility to add perforations later higher in the interval  however  it is probably worthwhile to avoid perforating gravel zones with d    gt    to   mm because gravel is more likely to block perforation ports and damage the pump  in many cases  particularly in channels  gravel zones are at the base of the interval  the lowermost perforations should be placed above these zones       initiating production and pumping in chops wells      the large sand influx in chops wells increases well rates  but it carries the risk that the pump may plug and a workover may be required  therefore  bringing a well onto production is a gradual process   the pump is started while liquid  called load fluid  and usually lighter oil is introduced in the annulus  when the system is flowing freely  the load fluid rate is diminished to increase drawdown  and sand should begin to enter the wellbore  drawdown and load fluid rate can be balanced to keep the pump operating effectively  but eventually load fluid input is stopped  within a day or two   if well capacity is sufficient  the pump is operated at maximum speed for the torque output  which is controlled at the drive head  if pump capacity exceeds the well capacity to deliver slurry  a lower speed is used   chops wells are maintained in an aggressively drawn down condition  which increases the effectiveness of the foamy oil mechanism in destabilizing sand and maintaining free flow into the perforations  low backpressure encourages gas and formation expansion   if bhp data are continuously available  they can be used to control the pump speed to maintain a     to    m annulus fluid level  otherwise  regular fluid level measurements are taken acoustically to optimize well performance   gas will evolve

hydrostatic head of the drilling fluid is intentionally designed to be lower than the pressure of the formations that are being drilled  the hydrostatic head of the fluid may naturally be less than the formation pressure  or it can be induced by adding natural gas  nitrogen  or air to the liquid phase of the drilling fluid  whether the underbalanced status is induced or natural  the result may be an influx of formation fluids that must be circulated from the well and controlled at surface the effective downhole circulating pressure of the drilling fluid is equal to the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column  plus associated friction pressures  plus any pressure applied on surface rtenotitleconventionally  wells are drilled overbalanced  in these wells  a column of fluid of a certain density in the hole provides the primary well control mechanism  the pressure on the bottom of the well will always be designed to be higher than the pressure in the formation     fig      a      file

friction of the fluid used   choke pressure  confining or active   which arises because of the pipe being sealed at surface  resulting in a positive pressure at surface   flow from any porous and permeable zones is likely to result when drilling underbalanced  this inflow of formation fluids must be controlled and any hydrocarbon fluids must be handled safely at surface the lower hydrostatic head avoids the buildup of filter cake on the formation as well as the invasion of mud and drilling solids into the formation  this helps to improve productivity of the well and reduce related drilling problems ubd produces an influx of formation fluids that must be controlled to avoid well control problems  this is one of the main differences from conventional drilling  in conventional drilling  pressure control is the main well control principle  while in ubd  flow control is the main well control principle  in ubd  the fluids from the well are returned to a closed system at

rates and multiphase flows occur  the stream is diverted through the tool   s barrel  thereby raising the velocity of flow and increasing the sensitivity to the point that diverting spinners can detect rates as low as    to    b d  a typical         in  tool has a barrel id of approximately      in  a flow of    b d results in a velocity of     ft min inside the barrel  because of the limited clearance between the spinner and the barrel  this velocity is enough to overcome friction and turn the spinner   furthermore  a flow of     b d passes through the barrel at    ft min  which is sufficient to start the homogenization of the flow  which eventually eliminates phase influence  in casing  a rate of       b d is needed to have the same effect around a continuous spinner  another benefit to multiphase flow application is that the tool can be calibrated directly for such flow  as long as the diversion is effective  casing size is not a parameter in the calibration  and the tool can be calibrated in the low rate range where phase bias is still important even inside the tool      types of diverting spinner flowmeters         hem packer flowmeter      one type of diverting flowmeter is the hem packer  the lower end of the diverter contains a coated fabric  quot skirt quot  with a   in  hem at the bottom  the skirt is opened by the metal struts to which it is attached  so that the momentum of the stream can effect a reasonable seal  a downhole pump inflates the hem with oil contained in the tool body  resulting in a seal that diverts practically the full stream through the barrel and past the spinner  a downhole motor expands and retracts the struts  the response of the tool to single phase flow is nearly linear  two interchangeable spinner elements are available   one with a small pitch for high sensitivity at low rates and a second with a larger pitch for rates up to approximately       rb d  because of its fragility  the tool never found widespread use  but is still available at some locations       basket  metal petal  flowmeter      another type of diverting flowmeter is the basket  metal petal  flowmeter  on the lower end  the basket is opened by motorized compression of its several struts  each of which is tack welded on its underside to a corresponding petal cut from sheet metal  as the struts are compressed to open the basket  the petals slip over each other so as to maintain some overlap even when the basket is fully opened  as the basket opens more to accommodate larger casing diameters  overlap between the petals decreases and leakage through the basket increases  strut travel is limited to prevent excessive opening and leakage  standard         in  tools accommodate casings as large as     in  nominal  some         in  tools can accommodate   in  casing  this is an operational feature that should be checked carefully when ordering this service  also  it is prudent to inquire whether the tool has been calibrated in a section of pipe of diameter close to the intended application  if not  the service company may not know the effect of leakage on spinner response   at the point where the outside of the struts meets the casing   s inside wall  the metal petals  which are attached to the inside of the struts  cannot deform enough to effect a complete seal  because of leakage around the struts the low flow rate response of the tool is nonlinear  attaching the petals to the outside of the struts would improve the seal  but would wear the petals quickly during use  destroying the tool   s main advantage  its ruggedness   there is very small clearance between the spinner and the id of the barrel  this feature assures almost no diversion of flow around the spinner  on the other hand  small particles of debris can plug the tool   as the spinner turns  it generates a specific number of voltage pulses per revolution  thus  the pulse rate from the tool can be transmitted through the logging cable for surface recording and determination of the corresponding revolutions per second  the number of pulses per revolution varies considerably from manufacturer to manufacturer  when ordering the service  it is recommended to inquire as to the number of pulses per revolution  more is better    typical basket flowmeters are rated for temperatures in the range of     to      f and for pressures in the range of        to        psia  the      in  tool typically accommodates       b d  maximum   the      in  tool        b d  and the   in  tool        b d  in each case  the tool length is

differential pressure between the cement and the formation fluid can lead to a significant loss of cement filtrate into the formation  if  however  large volumes of cement filtrate invade the rock  the possibility of formation damage exists      cement filtrates     the major constituents in the aqueous phase in contact with hydrating cement are    calcium silicates  calcium aluminates  calcium sulfates  calcium carbonates or bicarbonates  alkali sulfates  depending on the specific composition of the cement and its ph  the filtrate may be supersaturated with calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate  as the cement filtrate invades the formation and reacts with the formation minerals  its ph is reduced from  gt     to a ph buffered by the formation minerals  this rapid change in ph can

quantity of precipitate and rate of precipitation relative to fluid convection were important factors that controlled the extent and depth of permeability damage  cement filtrates that showed fast rates of precipitation tended to damage the upstream end of the core  whereas filtrates with slow precipitation rates tended to plug the downstream end of the core or not plug the core at all  the composition of the cement played an important role in determining both the quantity and the rates of precipitation  for example  the addition of lignin derivatives or polymer reduced the quantity of precipitate and resulted in less damage to the rock  the addition of cellulose derivatives  on the other hand  increased the rate and quantity of precipitation by an order of magnitude and resulted in

perforating is critical to well productivity because the perforation is the only channel of communication between the wellbore and the formation  during underbalanced perforating  the surge flow of fluid into the wellbore should clean the perforation tunnel of all disaggregated rock and liner debris  any remaining debris in the tunnel could plug gravel packs during production  even clean perforation tunnels show a narrow region of reduced permeability around them  the nature of this crushed or compacted zone around perforation tunnels created during perforating has been widely studied

evaluation  this article provides an overview of techniques used in determining porosity by nuclear magnetic resonance  nmr  logging techniques      measuring porosity     the initial amplitude of the spin echo train is proportional to the number of hydrogen nuclei associated with the fluids in the pores within the sensitive volume  this amplitude is calibrated in porosity units  see    eq        the accuracy of this amplitude measurement depends on three factors    a sufficiently long polarization time    t    w    is needed to achieve complete polarization of the hydrogen nuclei in the fluids  if   t    w   is too short  then the nmr porosity will be underestimated   a sufficiently short inter echo spacing    t    e    is needed to record the decays for fast relaxing fluids associated with highly viscous oils and or fluids residing in micro pores  if   t    e   is too long  micro porosity quantification will be inaccurate   the number of hydrogen nuclei in the fluid should equal the number in an equivalent volume of water  i e   hi       if the hi of any of the pore fluids is significantly less than    a correction to porosity is necessary   porosity was one of the earliest nmr measurements and is still an important one  assuming that the logging tool is properly calibrated and functioning normally  interpretation of the porosity measurement depends on several other factors  including vintage of the logging tool  whether hydrocarbons are present  and fluid type   there are two major contrasts between nmr porosity and conventional density and neutron nuclear porosity logs    nmr porosity does not depend on the mineralogy of the matrix  except in cases in which the formation contains significant amounts of ferromagnetic or paramagnetic materials  hence  it is considered a lithology independent measurement for most cases    nmr porosity is not sensitive to either borehole or mudcake and does not require corrections because the measurement zone  i e   sensitive volume  is focused within the formation  beyond the borehole wall and these influences  however  the rugosity of the wellbore will have to stay less than the range of doi  depth of investigation of the tool  to keep the sensitive volume of measurement in the formation  the frequency of the nmr experiments  bottomhole temperature and the conductivity of the borehole fluid are the main controls of the doi for the nmr tool as a function of its hardware specifics   the accuracy and precision of nmr derived porosity can be confirmed through comparisons with core porosity obtained using conventional laboratory measurement methods     fig          file vol  page      image      png    fig       comparison of core  and log nmr porosity  in this clean sandstone example  there is

log  nml  tool had such a large dead time  e g   minimum echo spacing    t    e    that it could not measure clay  and capillary bound fluids  thus  it was only capable of measuring free fluid porosity  which is now called nmr effective porosity  mphi   the minimum   t    e   used in the early versions of pulse nmr tools was still relatively large  and those tools still could not see all the clay bound fluids  with improvements in logging technology  most nmr logs recorded after      are considered  quot total porosity quot  logs  current logging tools use a minimum   t    e   of     ms in continuous mode and a   t    e   as small as     ms in stationary mode   in clean  water filled formations  mphi should approximately equal neutron density crossplot porosity  in shaly sands  mphi should approximately equal density porosity  calculated with the correct grain density  however  the mphi may not equal effective porosity because of the effects of hi and long   t    components

polymers  resins  and cement slurries  has historically been limited to shallow depths because of temperature concerns  but modern polymer and retarder technology allows for broader use   one of the following is often placed below the desired plugging location to provide a solid bottom in the wellbore    limit plug  cement basket  permanent bridge plug  sand pill  the dump bailer  containing a measured quantity of plugging material  is lowered to the desired depth  the bailer is opened either electronically by the wireline operator or mechanically by tagging the bridge plug and then raised to release the plugging material at this location  at times  the job is performed either with a lubricator on the wellhead or under overbalanced conditions so that the plugging fluid may achieve limited forced entry through gravel packs  perforations  and other passages into formation matrix      coiled tubing  ct      probably the most technically efficient way to spot fluid in a wellbore is to lay it in with ct  but it is not always the most economical or logistically efficient way  the process consists of placing the end of the ct at the bottom of the planned plug depth  and while the cement or other plugging slurry exits  the nozzle at the end of the coil slowly extracts the coil so that the pull out rate matches the fluid pump rate and keeps the end of the coil just below the top of the slurry  this placement method results in a volume of plugging fluid with little or no contamination in the wellbore  after placement  the operator may wash out the wellbore above the plug to establish a very accurate top of cement or apply squeeze pressure in some prescribed manner      bullheading or bradenhead placement     the bullheading or bradenhead placement method consists of injecting a plugging slurry into a formation with the intent to leave some portion of the plugging material in the wellbore  typically applied in cases of well control  lost circulation  or abandonment  this method is probably one of the less accurate placement methods because of the uncertainty of the fluid path   the general assumption is that the fluids will follow the path of least resistance  but that is not always reliable  consequently  when a slurry goes into the annulus rather than down into a lower portion of the wellbore  work strings are sometimes unintentionally cemented in the wellbore  despite the uncertainty involved  this plugging method has been used successfully when it is executed with caution      balanced plugs     probably the most common technique in both drilling and abandonment operations  the balanced plug method involves pumping the slurry through drillpipe or tubing until the level outside is equal to that inside the string  the volume and hydrostatics of wellbore fluids  preflushes  spacers  and plugging fluids must be carefully calculated to ensure that the system is being correctly balanced in the hole  the pipe or tubing is then

materials disposal  and site clearance  each step is discussed below       project management      project management  engineering  and planning for decommissioning an offshore rig generally starts three years before a well runs dry  the process involves    review of contractual obligations  engineering analysis  operational planning  contracting  because derrick barges are limited in number  many operators contract these vessels two to three years in advance  additionally  much of the decommissioning process requires special contractors who focus on a specific part of the process  most operators will contract out project management  cutting  civil engineering  and diving services       permitting and regulatory compliance      obtaining permits to decommission an offshore rig can take up to three years to complete  operators often contract local consulting firms to ensure that all permits are in order prior to decommissioning because those firms are familiar with the regulatory framework of their regions       platform preparation      to prepare a platform for decommissioning  tanks  processing equipment and piping must be flushed and cleaned and residual hydrocarbons have to be disposed of  platform equipment has to be removed  which includes cutting pipe and cables between deck modules  separating the modules  installing padeyes to lift the modules

construction process that remains in contact with the wellbore throughout the entire drilling operation  drilling fluid systems are designed and formulated to perform efficiently under expected wellbore conditions  advances in drilling fluid technology have made it possible to implement a cost effective  fit for purpose system for each interval in the well construction process      overview     the active drilling fluid system comprises a volume of fluid that is pumped with specially designed mud pumps from the surface pits  through the drillstring exiting at the bit  up the annular space in the wellbore  and back to the surface for solids removal and maintenance treatments as needed  the capacity of the surface system usually is determined by the rig size  and rig selection is determined by the well design  for example  the active drilling fluid volume on a deepwater well might be several thousand barrels  much of that volume is required to fill the long drilling riser that connects the rig floor to the seafloor  by contrast  a shallow well on land might only require a few hundred barrels of fluid to reach its objective      functions of drilling fluids     some of the basic functions of a drilling fluid are as follows    cleans the hole by transporting drilled cuttings to the surface  where they can be mechanically removed from the fluid before it is recirculated downhole    balances or overcomes formation pressures in the wellbore to minimize the risk of well control issues    supports and stabilizes the walls of the wellbore until casing can be set and cemented or openhole completion equipment can be installed    prevents or minimizes damage to the producing formation s     cools and lubricates the drillstring and bit    transmits hydraulic horsepower to the bit    allows information about the producing formation s  to be retrieved through cuttings analysis  logging while drilling data  and wireline logs      types of drilling fluids     world oil   s annual classification of fluid systemsworld oil      drilling  completion and workover fluids        world oil          f    lists nine distinct categories of drilling fluids  including    freshwater systems  saltwater systems  oil  or synthetic based systems  pneumatic  air  mist  foam  gas     fluid    systems  three key factors usually determine the type of fluid selected for a specific well    cost  technical performance  environmental impact  water based fluids  wbfs  are the most widely used systems  and are considered less expensive than oil based fluids  obfs  or synthetic based fluids  sbfs    the obfs and sbfs   also known as invert emulsion systems   have an oil or synthetic base fluid as the continuous or external  phase  and brine as the internal phase  invert emulsion systems have a higher cost per unit than most water based fluids  so they often are selected when well conditions call for reliable shale inhibition and or excellent lubricity  water based systems and invert emulsion systems can be formulated to tolerate relatively high downhole temperatures  pneumatic systems most commonly are implemented in areas where formation pressures are relatively low and the risk of lost circulation or formation damage is relatively high  the use of these systems requires specialized pressure management equipment to help prevent the development of hazardous conditions when hydrocarbons are encountered      drilling fluid considerations     drilling fluid selection remains one of the most important components of a successful well construction operation  drilling fluid service companies help operators to overcome the familiar issues  e g   lost circulation  as well as the challenges that are brought on by drilling in ultradeep waters  extreme hp ht formations  or remote environmentally sensitive areas by providing    analytical tools  test equipment  stockpoint facilities  innovative materials  the ability to simulate downhole conditions and optimize fluid design will continue to help reduce nonproductive time  and real time management of hole conditions through data feed from downhole tools allows the operator and drilling fluid specialist to fine tune drilling parameters   the demand for drilling waste management services that are dedicated to reducing  recovering  and recycling the volume of spent fluids and drilled cuttings continues to grow rapidly  these services and the related equipment have demonstrated their worth by helping operators achieve environmental compliance  reducing disposal costs  and returning

into account    casing limitations  economics  sand transport considerations that favor small diameter tubing      streamlining of the rod string      streamlining of the rod string is another effective way to minimize tubing flow restrictions  large diameter centralizers and or a number of sucker rod guides can contribute to significant incremental flow losses and should be avoided when

of small diameter flowlines and      elbows and tees should be avoided  because of the logarithmic effect that temperature typically has on viscosity  surface flow losses are usually quite temperature

run in all wells  so these data are available for making standard log analysis   s    w   calculations  a key consideration when making calibrated   s    w   calculations is the availability of special core analysis  scal  data on core samples from the particular reservoir  that is  the number of laboratory electrical property and   p    c     s    w   core plug measurements that have been made   the technique chosen to calculate   s    w   is often a hybrid that combines the use of two of these basic data sources  for example  the obm core   s    w   data can be used in combination with the resistivity logs to expand the data set used to include all wells and the whole of the hydrocarbon column  alternatively  the obm core   s    w   data can be used in combination with the   p    c     s    w   data  in this way  the obm core   s    w   data define the s w values for the majority of the reservoir  whereas the   p    c     s    w   data define the   s    w   values in the interval just above the fluid contact and perhaps in areas of the field where   p    c   data are available but obm core data are not      data availability and data quality     this section discussed the input data availability and data quality issues for each   s    w   technique  these considerations often control the initial choice of methodology to calculate   s    w   and need to be addressed at the start of the project to determine whether it is practically possible to fill gaps in the database in order to use a more accurate   s    w   calculation approach  this discussion assumes that accurate porosity values are available from the routine core analysis database and that porosity is calculated point by point from the well logs  the discussion focuses on particular aspects that affect the choice of   s    w   methodology  many of the database considerations are discussed on the petrophyscial database page       resistivity logs      wells generally have one variety or another of laterolog or induction resistivity log because they are broadly useful and because government regulations typically demand that they be recorded  this generally provides point by point data from the top of the hydrocarbon column down through any aquifer intervals that are present  however  in many fields  the early wells are spread thinly over the reservoir area  but the later development wells are drilled only in areas chosen to maximize rate and recovery while minimizing costs  this means that  often  few wells are drilled downdip where the hydrocarbon column thins

improvements in recent years  with significantly more details of quality control tests being reported by laboratories  yet only limited information has been published on this aspect of fluid sampling williams  j m        getting the best out of fluid samples  j pet technol              spe       pa   this section highlights the principal controls that should be performed and gives guidelines for selecting which samples are most likely to be representative      selecting samples for study     the primary objectives must be selection of a fluid that is most representative of the reservoir fluid and identification of any serious quality problems related to the samples or the sampling data  these problems must be communicated to the client before proceeding with the fluid study   poor sample quality can arise from such sources as sampling nonrepresentative fluid  human error during sampling or field transfers  contaminated sample containers  and leaks during shipment   for separator gas samples  the quality checks that should be made when the sample bottles have been heated to  or slightly above  separator temperature are   determination of opening pressure  compositional analysis  including air content  determination of residual liquids  possibly from carry over   separator liquids transported with a gas cap must be homogenized by pressurization and agitation  in this instance  the controls that must be performed are    determination of initial opening pressure  determination of bubblepoint pressure at ambient or  preferably  separator temperature  a check for presence of sediments or an aqueous phase  and  when feasible  flash separation to give gas oil ratio  gor   shrinkage  gas gravity  or composition   downhole samples should be checked in the same way  except that bubblepoint pressure can be measured at either ambient or reservoir temperature  measurement at reservoir temperature takes longer but is preferable for comparisons with downhole static or flowing pressures  ambient bubblepoint pressure estimates are often available from field transfers  but they should be used only as a guide because thorough mixing of the sample may not be achieved during recompression  and temperatures may be unstable  in downhole samples of a highly volatile oil or a gas condensate  no  quot break point quot  will be seen on the recompression curve  and a saturation pressure must be determined in a windowed pressure volume temperature pvt cell       selecting best sample from duplicates      the following are parameters that should be used  in order of preference  when a sample is selected on the basis of sample quality alone  i e   when samples are essentially duplicates collected at the same time and under the same conditions     an adequate sample volume or pressure  a downhole sample bubblepoint pressure lower than downhole pressure during sampling  contamination levels lower than  or similar to  duplicate samples  bottle opening pressures that agree with sampling data  i e   leaks are unlikely   surface sample bubblepoint pressures that agree with separator data  a close correlation between laboratory measurements on duplicate samples  one sample that represents  quot average quot  properties of duplicates       separator samples of oil and gas      for gas and oil samples collected from a separator  if at all possible  production test reports or other documentation should be studied in addition to the sampling sheets that normally accompany samples because a high proportion of sampling sheets contain inconsistencies  data should be studied with the following objectives    to identify what well or plant conditioning has been performed  to look for the stability of gas and liquid rates when the surface samples were taken and to calculate averages at the time the samples were taken  to ensure that the gor is based on oil flow rate at separator conditions  to determine which gas gravity and nonideality   z   factors were used  as well as the reference pressure and temperature  to verify reservoir temperature and static pressure       selecting samples based on field data      if all samples meet the quality criteria  the choice can be made on the basis of field data alone  although the selection tends to be a compromise in some cases  both operator and laboratory personnel must be involved in these choices  primary emphasis should be given to   samples collected after proper well conditioning  surface oil and gas samples taken simultaneously or close together  a downhole

operations was focused on improving volumetric sweep efficiency of waterfloods  more recently  polymers have been used extensively in disproportionate permeability reduction  dpr  and relative permeability modification  rpm  treatments for water shutoff and in conformance improvement polymer gel treatments  this page discusses polymers used in oilfield operations and how they contribute to conformance improvement      polymer fundamentals     polymers are large molecules and chemical entities referred to as macromolecules  polymer molecules are the resultant chemical specie when a large number of relatively small and repeating molecular entities  called monomers  are joined together chemically  the chemical process of joining together the monomers and forming polymer molecules is referred to as the polymerization reaction process  polymers  both natural and man made  have numerous beneficial uses and applications in modern society  everything from wood  to plastics  to man made thickening agents added to milk shakes   polymers can come in pure solid and liquid forms  some polymers can be dissolved in liquids  this article is limited to polymers that can be dissolved  or dispersed  in an aqueous solution and that usually increase the viscosity of the aqueous solution       basic oilfield polymer types      there are two fundamentally different types of water soluble and viscosity enhancing polymer chemistries that have been used during polymer waterflooding and conformance improvement treatments  the first type is biopolymers  such as xanthan gum polymer  the second type is man made synthetic polymers  such as acrylamide based polymers   biopolymers of the type used in conformance improvement are polysaccharides  poly sugars  in which the monomer chemical linkages of the polymer backbone are glycoside linkages  involving carbon oxygen carbon chemical bonds  in aqueous solution  the multistranded molecular complexes of xanthan polymer are fairly rigid molecular species  causing the polymer molecules to take on an extended molecular conformation   synthetic polymers of the type used in conformance improvement are usually highly flexible molecules in which the polymer backbone consists of a relatively chemically stable carbon molecular chain with single and flexible carbon carbon bonds  pendant water soluble chemical groups  e g   amide groups  on the molecule render the polymer molecule to be soluble in water   synthetic polymers have emerged to become the predominant and preferred polymer type for use in commercial oilfield conformance improvement operations because of the inherent chemical and biological stability of synthetic polymers  along with injectivity and cost issues   historically  the two types of biopolymers primarily used in polymer waterflooding have been xanthan and scleroglucan polymers  the only synthetic polymers that have been used extensively during polymer waterflooding  and in polymer gel conformance treatments  are those based on acrylamide polymer chemistry       viscosity enhancement and permeability reduction      water soluble polymers used in conformance improvement operations operate by reducing fluid mobility by increasing viscosity of the oil recovery drive fluid  primarily the flood water  and or by reducing permeability  by which the polymers  directly or indirectly  act as a fluid flow blocking agent  reducing permeability is the conformance improvement mechanism by which conformance treatments operate when polymers and polymer gels are used for imparting dpr  polymers used in waterfloods often have a secondary component in their conformance improvement mechanism that involves permeability reduction within the flooded volume of a matrix rock reservoir       chemistry of polymers used in conformance improvement      the chemistry of polymers used in conformance improvement is reviewed before discussing polymer waterflooding and dpr polymer treatments because several of the polymer chemistries that are reviewed are used in both of these oilfield conformance improvement applications  in fact  some of the polymer chemistries discussed in this section are also used in conformance improvement polymer gels       biopolymers      in addition to being environmentally friendly and readily available  advantages of biopolymers are their relative insensitivity to salinity and mechanical shear degradation  the two major concerns relating to the use of biopolymers are their susceptibility to biological and chemical degradation  and injectability

of data  and quality control of samples   reservoir fluid property measurements derive from a complicated series of processes relying both on the operation of equipment and the performance of people  so the scope for errors is very significant  the overriding challenge in fluid sampling is that of ensuring that the fluid entering the sample container is representative of the bulk fluid being sampled  it is equally important that the sample remains representative during handling and storage  until all required measurements have been completed  although thorough sample checking procedures can identify some of the most obvious problems  there is never absolute certainty that the fluid under study is truly representative of the reservoir fluid  on occasion  laboratory measurements can show that a fluid is definitely not representative  e g   saturation pressure is significantly higher than reservoir pressure   but even here the problem could lie with errors in field measurement data rather than with the samples themselves  thus  it is essential that all the necessary precautions are taken to prevent poor samples from leading to erroneous physical property measurements      fig       is a schematic diagram illustrating some of the most common sources of error in relation to the collection of production samples and data in the field  perhaps the most important  yet often misunderstood  phase of any sampling program is that of well conditioning  a poorly conditioned well may still be producing drilling mud filtrate  workover fluids  or reaction products and  in extreme cases  such materials may remain even after months of production  a conflicting aim of well conditioning is to avoid excessive pressure drawdown and the creation of a large region of two phase reservoir fluid around the wellbore  which may be difficult to remove  this is especially important in the case of gas condensate reservoirs  of which many are found at their saturation pressures  the

production and solve problems of reservoir engineering began around       initially  pressures were calculated using fluid levels  a later method was to inject gas into the tubing until the pressure became constant  the earliest bottomhole pressure measurements were made with one time reading pressure bombs and maximum indicating or maximum recording pressure gauges that lacked the accuracy  reliability  or durability of present day technology the varied uses of bottomhole pressure and temperature measurements have increased in scope during the past two decades as instrumentation technologies have produced more reliable and accurate tools  these advances have made more applications possible  including use in multilayer reservoirs  horizontal wells  interference testing  and drawdown test interpretation this chapter is focused mainly on the types of measurements made and the tools available  some information is included on interpretation techniques to connect the data acquisition with its use in characterizing a reservoir and its contents  detailed explanations of these interpretation techniques can be found in other chapters in this   handbook   __toc__     reservoir pressure     the measurement commonly referred to as  quot bottomhole pressure quot  is a measurement of the fluid pressure in a porous reservoir  the reservoir pore fluid pressure is a fraction of the overburden pressure that is supported by the fluid system  the other portion is supported by the rock and generates the in situ rock stress  the overburden pressure is created by the weight of the rocks composing the lithostatic column at the point of observation  hence  the difference between the overburden pressure and the vertical rock stress can approximate the pore pressure at original  or virgin  conditions  the vertical pressure profile reflects the distribution of fluids in the reservoir and may also indicate compartmentalization resulting from fluid flow barriers  within any reservoir compartment  the pressure gradient reflects the density of the continuous fluid phase in the reservoir  hence the position of fluid contacts     fig         illustrates a typical pressure profile showing gas   oil   and water bearing intervals of a reservoir at initial conditions  file vol  page      image      png    fig          pressure gradients in a well drilled in a virgin reservoir       in a developed reservoir  differential depletion of lithostatic layers with various permeabilities and the movement of fluid contacts can change the pressure profile  monitoring the static pressures vs  time in developed reservoirs is a crucial tool for reservoir management       pressure distribution in the reservoir during fluid flow      the fluid flow chapter in this volume of the   handbook   explains the factors that govern the flow of fluids through porous media for steady state  pseudosteady state  and transient flow conditions      steady state flow

pseudosteady state flow behavior is observed when a well reaches stabilized production from a limited drainage volume  for constant rate production under pseudosteady state conditions  the difference between the flowing wellbore pressure and the average reservoir pressure in the drainage volume is constant  and the pressure drawdown is a linear function of time  the late time buildup pressure will level off to the average reservoir pressure if the buildup duration is sufficiently long  pressure depletion occurs with continued pseudosteady state production      transient flow       transient flow is most often modeled with the radial diffusivity equation  which allows modeling pressure vs  time and pressure vs  distance from an observation point  typically  a well  at a sufficiently large time  the pressure disturbance anywhere in the reservoir is proportional to the logarithm of the inverse square of the radius away from the origin of the disturbance  thus  the magnitude of the disturbance is maximum near its origin  the wellbore  and rapidly terminates away from the wellbore  because the pressure wave is affected by the reservoir fluid transmissibility    kh           higher transmissibility results in smaller pressure differentials and vice versa  this effect explains why high resolution pressure gauges are necessary to

pose the greatest difficulty in the successful use of progressive cavity  pc  pumps matthews  c m   alhanati  f j s  and dall   acqua  d        pc pumping system design considerations for light oil applications  paper presented at the      progressing cavity pump workshop  tulsa     november  in fact  the current use of pcp systems in many medium  and light oil wells can be attributed to the recent development of new elastomers that can withstand the produced fluid chemistry  allowing reasonable pump run lives to be achieved  however  further developments and improvements are required because there are still relatively few pcps used in fields producing light oils with gravities  gt      api  the presence of different quantities of carbon dioxide  methane and hydrogen sulfide gases  aromatics  and paraffins in the produced fluids  as well as different downhole temperature conditions  requires that special consideration be given to elastomer selection  pump sizing  and well operation  aromatics such as benzene and toluene typically induce swelling of the stator elastomer  which makes pump sizing more difficult  whereas h s can cause extended vulcanization  which results in hardening and eventual breakdown of the elastomer material  diffusion of a significant quantity of gas  in particular  co   into the stator elastomer can lead to blistering or fracturing of the rubber because of rapid decompression of the pump during shutdowns      pump selection     pump selection should be based on geometry considerations and stator elastomer properties to minimize the swell potential  although some swelling of the elastomer is inevitable in most cases  depending on the type of elastomer and the downhole conditions  total elastomer swelling can exceed   to   vol  in extreme cases  although much lower percentages are usually required for a pump to operate effectively and have a reasonable run life  performing swell tests is highly recommended to assist in pump selection and sizing when fluid compatibility is expected to be an issue  experience has shown that the swelling process can be quite gradual  with it sometimes taking up to   months for the stator to reach the maximum swell condition  to compensate for the substantial swelling expected in some challenging well applications  pumps may be sized so loosely that they cannot generate any flow at pressures below their rated capacity in a standard bench test  in such cases  the sizing process is usually a delicate balance because  if pumps are fit too loosely  they will not be able to generate sufficient head to produce fluid to surface for a long period of time  one approach used to avoid low initial pumping efficiency because of loose sizing requirements is to complete the initial pump installation with a tighter fit rotor and then occasionally to replace the rotor with progressively smaller sizes as the stator swells  however  this approach obviously requires additional workovers  which must be justified by the economics of the operation and comparison to other practical options   given the many parameters that can influence pump life  it is highly recommended that operators maintain a detailed database of all pump testing and field performance records to establish optimal pump selection and sizing criteria  this information is also crucial in terms of monitoring failure causes and effectively guiding pump replacement decisions as well conditions change      issues and remedies         gas expansion      the most common problem associated with gas diffusion into a stator is the damage caused by expansion of the gas trapped within the elastomer as a result of the rapid decompression that may occur under shutdown conditions  elastomer selection is obviously important under such conditions because some materials are much less prone to damage than others  although the options available to prevent rapid decompression and potential damage to the pump are limited  use of drive systems with brakes that prevent rapid drainage of the tubing during shutdown events is highly recommended in these situations  there was also a unique check valve product available previously that prevented the fluid column in the tubing from draining through the pump in the event of a shutdown  caution should be exercised when attempting to restart such wells immediately after a shutdown to avoid a high torque overload condition and potential pump damage  it is also very important to avoid multiple restart attempts in rapid succession because this may lead to reduced brake effectiveness  rod string failures  or severe pump damage  if a high torque condition can be attributed to stator swelling expansion  the options are to load the tubing string to surface before attempting a restart or simply leaving the well shut down for several hours  perhaps a full day  to give the elastomer time

quantity and controlled nature of the cycling   again  intelligent completion installations are designed to fulfill specific operational requirements such as severe environmental conditions  for example  scaling of wellbores can adversely affect the performance of control devices  careful monitoring of the performance of these devices is required to determine any degradation such that regular

are time independent and relate stress and pore pressure  only through the effective stress law  these do not account for the fact that stress changes induce pore pressure changes  and vice versa  nor do these models account for thermal and chemical effects and their relationships to pore pressure and stress  in this section  we briefly discuss each of these issues and how they affect wellbore stability analysis  we start with a discussion of failure caused by anisotropic rock strength  which is a characteristic of consolidated shales that can cause considerable problems in wells drilled at oblique angles to bedding   while the examples shown here demonstrate that it is possible to quantify uncertainties in the minimum safe mud weight  it is also possible to quantify uncertainties in the maximum safe mud weight  in that case  the likelihood of success decreases with increasing mud weight  and the two edges of the field defining the most stable mud weights form a possibly skewed bell shaped curve      anisotropic strength     in many rocks  lithified shales in particular   the elastic properties are anisotropic  in other words  they are a function of the orientation of the applied stress with respect to bedding planes  in general  shales are stiffer along the bedding planes than perpendicular to bedding   at the same time  the rock strength is also anisotropic  in both cases  the anisotropy is caused by a preferred orientation of shale particles that generally becomes more pronounced with compaction   a well that is drilled perpendicular to shale bedding is generally not affected by bedding parallel weakness planes  however  when a well is drilled at an oblique angle to bedding  bedding parallel weakness planes can become very important     fig       shows an acoustic wellbore image of breakouts that occur along oblique bedding planes intersecting a well  demonstrating that this mode of failure does occur  in fact  in this well failure associated with weak bedding

through interbedded massive and laminated sands  wider breakouts  dark bands  can be seen in the laminated sands above         ft  where laminations are less frequent  the breakouts are narrower  this pattern indicates wellbore failure in the laminated sands being exacerbated by weak bedding planes          fig       is an example plot that shows the required mud weight as a function of wellbore orientation for wells drilled through dipping beds that are highly anisotropic and illustrates the two angles required to define the orientation of a well with respect to bedding  the first angle is the attack angle  which is simply the angle between the well axis and the normal to the bedding plane  the larger the attack angle  the more likely it is that failure will occur because of bedding parallel weakness planes  the second is the angle between the dip direction and the projection of the well axis onto the bedding plane  while in general it is found that wells drilled updip or downdip are more stable than those drilled along strike  the relationship depends critically on the orientations and magnitudes of the in situ stresses    file devol      final page     image      png    fig      the upper diagram defines two angles that are used to describe the orientation of a well with respect to bedding  the lower figures show the mud weight  in ppg  required to maintain stability as a function of wellbore orientation for a highly anisotropic shale if the weak bedding planes are ignored  on the left  and considered  on the right   pale grays show that low mud weights are required for wells drilled approximately perpendicular to bedding  whereas darker grays show that higher mud weights are required for wells drilled obliquely to bedding  courtesy geomechanics intl  inc         both of these effects can be seen in the lower right stability plot shown in    fig        which indicates the mud weight required to maintain stability as a function of wellbore orientation    the bedding normal is shown in this plot as a white dot   the lighter gray shading close to the dot indicates that lower mud weights are required for wells drilled nearly perpendicular to the bedding planes   darker colors show that high mud weights are required for wells drilled obliquely to bedding   the highest mud weights are required for wells drilled with moderate to high deviations to the east northeast  ene   the asymmetry in the plot is a characteristic of the effect of strength anisotropy  and it is caused by the complex interplay between the stress field concentrated around the well and the weak bedding planes  for comparison  the lower left stability plot shows recommend

framing to support the roof plates  intermediate columns are used for diameters greater than     ft  designs may include a frangible roof joint for added protection in the event of a sudden increase in internal pressure  in this case the design pressure is limited to the equivalent pressure of the dead weight of the roof plates including structural rafters  other fixed roof designs such as the self supporting dome roof or umbrella roof may be used if storage pressures exceed the capabilities of the cone roof design  depending on the size  diameter  of the tank  api   standard

measurement standards  chap      a     quot gauging quot  includes measuring the amount of liquid contained in the tank as well as determining the temperature of the liquid and obtaining representative samples      filling or pumping operations     normal tank filling and pumping operations also affect the vapor space of a fixed roof tank  when product is removed from the tank  air is drawn into the vapor space as liquid is removed  creating a hazard  during the holding period before the next tank filling operation  evaporative breathing losses increase because of the increased volume of the vapor space  when product is added to the tank  the increasing liquid volume displaces the air vapor mixture through the tank vent  resulting in significant evaporative emissions      gas blanketing systems     as long as the product vapor pressure is low  below     psia   it is considered safe practice to use a freely ventilated fixed roof tank  for production tanks or other applications in which vapor pressure of the incoming liquid normally exceeds atmospheric pressure at normal ambient temperatures  a gas blanketing system is required to maintain a positive tank pressure and minimize the chance of air being drawn into the tank vapor space  during periods of no inflow  the tank breathing process alone could cause air to flow into the tank through the pressure vacuum valve and form an explosive mixture   a gas blanketing system includes a suitable supply of natural gas and a pressure regulator that operates as needed to maintain the tank pressure at a predetermined level  during the heat of the day  as pressure increases  the regulator closes  if pressure continues to rise  the pressure vent opens to relieve tank internal pressure by venting vapors

gradients are common  these situations require the use of low density cement systems that reduce the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid column during cement placement  consequently  lightweight

excess of    lbm gal   there are several different types of materials that can be used as extenders  these include    physical extenders  clays and organics   pozzolanic extenders  chemical extenders  gases  any material with a specific gravity lower than that of the cement will act as an extender  these materials  in general  decrease the density of cement slurries by one of three means  the pozzolanic and inert organic materials have a lower density than cement and can be used to partially replace cement  lowering the density of the solid material in the slurry  in the case of the physical and chemical extenders  they not only have a lower density  but also absorb water  allowing more water to be added to the slurry without producing free fluid or particle segregation  the gases behave differently in that they are used to produce foamed cements that have exceptionally low density with acceptable compressive strengths   in many lightweight slurries  it is common to use a combination of the different types of material  for example  pozzolanic and chemical extenders are  or can be  used with physical extenders and or gases  pozzolan slurry designs almost always incorporate bentonite  and gases generally have a chemical extender to stabilize the foam  lightweight additives also increase the slurry yield and can result in an economical slurry      physical extenders     these are particulate materials that function as cement extenders by increasing the water requirements or by reducing the average specific gravity of the dry mix  there are two general classes of materials that fall into this category  clays and inert organic materials  the most commonly used clay material is bentonite  although attapulgite is also used  the commonly used inert organic materials are    perlite  gilsonite  ground coal  ground rubber      bentonite  gel       this extender is a colloidal clay mineral composed predominately of sodium montmorillonite  naal  alsi o       oh   the montmorillonite content of bentonite is the controlling factor in its effectiveness as an extender  it is one of two extenders that are covered by an api specification  bentonite can be added to any api class of cement  and is commonly used in conjunction with other extenders  bentonite is used to    prevent solids separation  reduce free water  reduce fluid loss  increase slurry yield  bentonite is typically used at concentrations of   to     bwoc  it may be dry blended with the cement or prehydrated in the mixing water  in prehydrating  the effect of    bwoc prehydrated is approximately equal to      bwoc dry blended  but the yield point is much higher  for best results  the prehydrated bentonite water mixture should be used for mixing the cement slurry shortly after prehydration has been completed  laboratory testing is advised to determine the proper gel concentration and mixing procedure for prehydrated bentonite  tech grade or    mud gel    should not be substituted for cement grade bentonite  lignosulfonate is commonly used as a dispersant and retarder in high gel cements to reduce the slurry viscosity       attapulgite  salt gel       this is a more effective extender than bentonite in seawater or high salt slurries  but it is not regulated or does not have a specification  attapulgite   mg al    oh si o        h o  is composed of clusters of fibrous needles that require high shear to be dispersed in water  it produces many of the same effects as bentonite  except that it does not reduce fluid loss   a disadvantage of attapulgite is that  because of the similarity of the fibers to those of asbestos  its use has been prohibited in some countries  granular forms are available that may be permitted as a replacement       expanded perlite      expanded perlite is a siliceous volcanic glass that is heat processed to form a porous particle that contains entrained air  it is a highly buoyant product that requires the addition of   to    bwoc bentonite to prevent separation from the slurry  because of its low crush strength  the water requirement for perlite containing slurries must be increased to allow for slurry compressibility

this article discusses considerations in use of foams as blocking agents      concept     because foams are exceptionally effective at reducing gas permeability  they are good candidates for use in gas blocking treatments that are placed relatively near to producing wellbores  the foam   s low effective density results in the tendency for selective placement in the upper sections of the reservoir where gas  especially coning and cusping  is entering the wellbore  the obvious and major challenges that must be overcome to successfully apply foams as a gas blocking agents are to assure that the emplaced blocking foam will have adequate strength and that the metastable foam will be stable long enough to result in attractive economics      laboratory studies and treatment design     treatment design and laboratory studies in support of applying foam gas blocking treatments need to assure the following    foam has adequate strength to function as intended under actual reservoir conditions  including adequate strength within the maximum permeability rock to be blocked sealed and adequate strength to withstand the maximum differential pressure that will be encountered   foam has adequate durability and stability to function as intended under actual reservoir conditions for at least the minimum intended economic life of the foam gas blocking treatment  including adequate thermal stability  adequate stability to the reservoir oil and to the salinity of the reservoir brine  and adequate stability in the presence of the reservoir minerals and lithologies to be encountered   foam can be emplaced and or generated in the desired reservoir volume to be treated      foams for reducing gas coning     the use of foams as blocking agents to reduce or eliminate gas coning in matrix rock reservoirs has long been studied  one concept is to inject a foaming solution at  or near  the gas oil contact  goc   as gas cones down through the foaming solution  it is proposed that gas blocking foam will form in situ and reduce or eliminate gas coning  more recently  it has been proposed that the foaming solution in this case should be a hydrocarbon solution  for a properly designed treatment  gravity forces will tend to promote the selective placement of the hydrocarbon foaming solution at the goc  just as desired  dalland and hanssen reported on a laboratory

smaller than the foam volume required for mobility control purposes  in concept  the volume of the foam placed through a production well needs only be large enough to provide sufficient strength and durability to assure effective gas blockage  the volume and depth of foam placement for such a treatment will vary substantially with the foam formula used  the permeability and mineralogical nature of the reservoir volume being treated  and the drawdown pressure that the foam gas blocking treatment will experience  no exact treatment size guidelines for foam gas blocking treatments are available  the sizing of such foam treatments needs to be determined on a well by well and treatment by treatment basis

the initial field discovery and continuing until the original energy sources for oil expulsion are no longer alone able to sustain profitable producing rates  quot  muskat  m        physical principles of oil production  new york city  mcgraw hill book co  inc  primary recovery is also sometimes referred to as pressure depletion because it necessarily involves the decline of the reservoir pressure  primary recovery should be distinguished clearly from secondary recovery  muskat defines secondary recovery as  quot the injection of  fluids  after the reservoir has reached a state of substantially complete depletion of its initial content of energy available for  fluid  expulsion or where the production rates have approached the limits of profitable operation  quot  muskat  m        physical principles of oil production  new york city  mcgraw hill book co  inc  one of the most popular secondary recovery methods is waterflooding  because primary recovery invariably results in pressure depletion  secondary recovery requires  quot repressuring quot  or increasing the reservoir pressure primary recovery includes pressure maintenance methods  muskat defines pressure maintenance as  quot the operation of  fluid  injection into a reservoir during the course of its primary production history  quot  muskat  m        physical principles of oil production  new york city  mcgraw hill book co  inc  the main effect of pressure maintenance is to mitigate the reservoir   s pressure decline and conserve its energy  the purpose of pressure maintenance is ultimately to improve oil recovery  the most common injected fluids for pressure maintenance are water and separator or residue gas   quot partial quot  and  quot complete quot  pressure maintenance describe the general effectiveness of a given pressure maintenance operation to retard the rate of pressure decline  partial pressure maintenance refers to fluid injection while a general state of pressure decline still exists  full or complete pressure maintenance refers to fluid injection while the reservoir pressure remains essentially constant according to muskat   s definition of pressure maintenance  secondary recovery methods such as waterflooding are not strictly pressure maintenance operations because they begin after pressure depletion  however  if water injection takes place before the end of pressure depletion  which is not uncommon  it is considered a pressure maintenance method  if water is injected before the end of primary recovery  the reservoir is classified as an artificial waterdrive  since muskat first proposed his definition  others have loosely applied the term pressure maintenance to include any fluid injection strategy at any stage in the reservoir   s production oil reservoirs are classified according to their fluid type  there are three broad oil classes  in order of increasing molecular weight  they are volatile oil  black oil  and heavy oil  heavy oil reservoirs are of minor interest during pressure depletion because they typically yield only marginal amounts of oil because of their low dissolved gas contents and high fluid viscosities  although heavy oil reservoirs are not addressed specifically in this chapter  the methods of analysis presented here are equally applicable to them  the distinguishing characteristic between volatile and black oils is the stock tank oil content of their equilibrium gases  equilibrium gases liberated from volatile oils contain appreciable stock tank or condensable liquids whereas the gases from black oils contain negligible stock tank liquids  while this distinction leads to only slightly different recovery strategies  it leads to very different methods of analysis and mathematical modeling requirements __toc__     volatile  and black oil fluid characteristics     the petroleum fluid spectrum is gradational  there is no strict definition of volatile and black oils  there are only general guidelines and characteristics  despite this lack of precision and the occasional confusion it brings  classification is quite useful and popular molecular weight is a useful yardstick  black oils typically range from    to     in molecular weight but may range as high as     to      in contrast  volatile oils are lower in molecular weight than black oils and typically range from    to     oils with molecular weights greater than     usually are classified as heavy oils  fluids with molecular weights of less than    are generally gases  which include gas condensates  wet gases  and dry gases  a molecular weight of    marks the lower molecular weight limit of volatile oils black and volatile oils are sometimes subdivided into different fluid types  for instance  volatile oils include near critical fluids and high shrinkage oils  near critical fluids represent light volatile oils and can include some very rich condensates

its gauge size and shape and or its structural integrity  this articles discusses the causes  types  effects  and possible prevention of borehole instability      causes     the causes can be grouped into the following categories    mechanical failure caused by in situ stresses  erosion caused by fluid circulation  chemical caused by interaction of borehole fluid with the formation     types and associated problems     there are four different types of borehole instabilities    hole closure or narrowing  hole enlargement or washouts  fracturing  collapse     fig       illustrates hole instability problems    file devol      final page     image      png    fig      types of hole instability problems           hole closure      hole closure is a narrowing time dependent process of borehole instability  it sometimes is referred to as creep under the overburden pressure  and it generally occurs in plastic flowing shale and salt sections  problems associated with hole closure are    increase in torque and drag  increase in potential pipe sticking  increase in the difficulty of casings landing      hole enlargement      hole enlargements are commonly called washouts because the hole becomes undesirably larger than intended  hole enlargements are generally caused by    hydraulic erosion  mechanical abrasion caused by drillstring  inherently sloughing shale  the problems associated with hole enlargement are    increase in cementing difficulty  increase in potential hole deviation  increase in hydraulic requirements for effective hole cleaning  increase in potential problems during logging operations      fracturing      fracturing occurs when the wellbore drilling fluid pressure exceeds the formation fracture pressure  the associated problems are lost circulation and possible kick occurrence       collapse      borehole collapse occurs when the drilling fluid pressure is too low to maintain the structural integrity of the drilled hole  the associated problems are pipe sticking and possible loss of well      principles of borehole instability     before drilling  the rock strength at some depth is in equilibrium with the in situ rock stresses  effective overburden stress  effective horizontal confining stresses   while a hole is being drilled  however  the balance between the rock strength and the in situ stresses is disturbed  in addition  foreign fluids are introduced  and an interaction process begins between the formation and borehole fluids  the result is a potential hole instability problem  although a vast amount of research has resulted in many borehole stability simulation models  all share the same shortcoming of uncertainty in the input data needed to run the analysis  such data include    in situ stresses  pore pressure  rock mechanical properties  formation and drilling fluids chemistry     mechanical rock failure mechanisms     mechanical borehole failure occurs when the stresses acting on the rock exceed the compressive or the tensile strength of the rock  compressive failure is caused by shear stresses as a result of low mud weight  while tensile failure is caused by normal stresses as a result of excessive mud weight   the failure criteria that are used to predict hole instability problems are the maximum normal stress criterion for tensile failure and the maximum strain energy of distortion criterion for compressive failure  in the maximum normal stress criterion  failure is said to occur when  under the action of combined stresses  one of the acting principal stresses reaches the failure value of the rock tensile strength  in the maximum of energy of distortion criterion  failure is said to occur when  under the action of combined stresses  the energy of distortion reaches the same energy of failure of the rock under pure tension      shale instability     shales make up the majority of drilled formations  and cause most wellbore instability problems  ranging from washout to complete collapse of the hole  shales are fine grained sedimentary rocks composed of clay  silt  and  in some cases  fine sand  shale types range from clay rich gumbo  relatively weak  to shaly siltstone  highly cemented   and have in common the characteristics of extremely low permeability and a high proportion of clay minerals  more than     of drilled formations worldwide are shale formations  the drilling cost attributed to shale instability problems is reported to be in excess of one half billion u s dollars per year  the cause of shale instability is two fold  mechanical  stress change vs  shale strength environment  and chemical  shale fluid interaction   capillary pressure  osmotic pressure  pressure diffusion  borehole fluid invasion into shale        mechanical instability      as stated previously  mechanical rock instability can occur because the in situ stress state of equilibrium has been disturb

analysis design  installation and testing of basic surface safety systems for offshore production platforms        washington  dc  api  a safety analysis approach based on a number of traditional hazards analysis techniques such as failure mode effects analysis  fmea  and hazard and operability studies  hazops   the purpose of a safety analysis is to identify undesirable events that might pose a threat to safety and define reliable protection measures that will prevent such events or minimize their effects should they occur  potential threats to safety are identified through proven hazards analysis techniques that have been adapted to hydrocarbon production processes  recommended protective measures are common industry practices proved through many years of operating experience  the hazards analysis and protective measures have been combined into a  quot safety analysis quot  for onshore and offshore production facilities   the   rp   c  api rp   c  analysis design  installation and testing of basic surface safety systems for offshore production platforms        washington  dc  api  safety analysis is based on the following premises    process components function in the same manner regardless of specific facility design   each process component is analyzed for  quot worst case quot  input and output conditions   if fully protected when analyzed standing alone  the analysis will be valid for that component in any configuration   if every component is protected  the system will be protected   when components are assembled into a system  some devices can be eliminated   the major benefits of this analysis are    concise  easy to audit documentation  minimized subjective decisions  consistent results  this page explains the basic concepts of protection used in the analysis  discusses the methods of analyzing the process  and establishes design criteria for an integrated safety system  the entire production process is covered  and a step by step summary for performing a safety analysis is provided      process variables     there are four main process variables in upstream production facilities    pressure  liquid level  temperature  flow  a variable fluctuates between a lower and an upper extreme value  for example  the liquid level within a vessel can fluctuate from the bottom of the vessel  empty  to the top  full   process variables allow movement of the fluids through the process components while simultaneously achieving the degree of separation required for sales or water disposal      process components     a process component is any piece of equipment that handles hydrocarbons  identifying all the components that handle hydrocarbons in a production facility would be overwhelming  instead of listing components by their common name    rp   c  _ lists components by their functions  thus decreasing the number of names from hundreds to only ten  regardless of what a piece of equipment is called  it can be described as one of the following ten process components    wellheads and flowlines  wellhead injection lines  headers  pressure vessels  atmospheric vessels  fired and exhaust heated components  pumps  compressors  pipeline  shell and tube heat exchangers     normal operating ranges     whenever hydrocarbons are present in a process component  each of the four main process variables take on some value  values at which the variables can be found when things are going smoothly are called normal values  for example  the pressure on a flowline will fluctuate from reading to reading within a specified period of time  e g   for a   hour period the readings may be     psi at      hours        psi at      hours  and     psi at      hours   as long as flow is occurring  the liquid level within a process component will be changing  for example  in a separator   s oil bucket  the level will steadily rise until the dump valve opens and drains some of the oil  at which time the liquid level falls until the dump valve closes  within each process component  each variable has a normal operating range instead of having a single normal value   one of the cornerstones of facility protection lies in protecting each component against certain undesirable events that are closely related to the four main process variables  for example  if the pressure within a component were to become too high  a component could rupture  a pressure too low within a component could indicate a leak  a liquid level within a component that is too high or too low could cause problems as well as indicate equipment failure   production operators establish normal operating ranges  the principal concern with the four main process variables is that their sensing devices  which respond to conditions outside normal ranges  have enough time to respond before problems occur  for example  the normal range for a separator   s liquid level can be whe

contained in the vapor phase in the gas  is adsorbed by the desiccant at relatively low temperatures  the affinity for water is temperature dependent  and the affinity for water is broken at high temperatures  such as      f  it is necessary to avoid liquid water droplets from contacting the silica gel  as liquid water damages the desiccant  thus  it is important to have effective gas liquid

reason  the process incorporates two towers  while one tower is on adsorption  the other tower is being regenerated by the application of heat through a small slipstream of gas and subsequent cooling  the regeneration time is slightly less than the adsorption time of the first tower  thus  when one tower is fully saturated  the second tower has been fully regenerated  the towers are then switched

ft  in addition to addressing concerns about the freezing of water based fluids and cement  the engineer must also design surface casing for the unique loads generated by the thawing and refreezing of the permafrost  there are also road and foundation design problems  associated with ice rich surface permafrost  that are not addressed here      loading of permafrost     the following is a qualitative description of the loading mechanism in permafrost  if we consider a block of permafrost before thaw  the overburden and lateral earth pressures surrounding this block are balanced by the intergranular stresses between the soil panicles and the pore pressure in the ice  upon thaw  the ice changes to water  the volume of the pore fluid decreases by about     and the pore pressure decreases  the soil compacts to maintain equilibrium  and increases intergranular forces until a new stress state is reached that balances the surrounding earth pressures   the loading of the permafrost is the pore pressure change caused by the phase change of the pore ice  illustrated in    fig        the pore pressure is discontinuous at the thaw boundary  and equal to   p  associated with the thaw is a body force or    gravity like    loading caused by the gradient of the pore pressure change  this loading is equivalent to the loss of the buoyant pressure of the ice on the soil particles    file devol      final page     image      png    fig      loading mechanisms in thawed permafrost       the mechanical response of the permafrost to the pore pressure loads determines the casing loads  experiments on simulated deep frozen permafrost show that it can be characterized as a linear  isotropic elastic material with coefficients corresponding to the compressibility  c  and shear modulus  g  these moduli are functions of    the mean normal effective stress  the soil type  the degree of consolidation of the soil  determining the pore pressure loading requires knowledge of the pore pressure before and after thaw  thaw subsidence and freeze back field tests at prudhoe bay suggest that the initial pore pressure is hydrostatic  the following mechanisms influence the final pore pressure    water may flow into the thawed zone from the surface  the base of the permafrost  or horizontally through the permafrost   water may flow from one part of the thaw zone to another   dissolved or trapped gases within the frozen ice may evolve and maintain some pressure upon thaw   the soil may compact so that the pore spaces are no longer undersaturated   if the compaction is sufficient to remove voidage and recompress the pore water  then the pressure within the pore space will rise  this limiting compaction is particularly important near the base of the permafrost  where the permafrost contains initially unfrozen water  unfrozen water leads to a smaller amount of voidage upon thaw  hence  compaction and repressurization occur at lower soil strains  unfrozen water may occur as a result of the effects of salinity and of adsorption in fine grained materials  these effects not only depress the initial freezing point  but also cause freezing to occur over a range of several degrees      internal freeze back     most of the discovery wells in the prudhoe bay field were lost because of the freezing of annular fluids  this failure mode is called internal freeze back  to distinguish it from the refreezing of the permafrost  called external freeze back  the solution to internal freeze back is to replace freezeable fluids in the annuli with nonfreezeable fluids  such as oil based fluids or alcohol based fluids  such as glycol  complete displacement of water based fluids is essential for successful mitigation of internal freeze back      permafrost cementing     experience has shown that a cement system used for permafrost cementing must meet a minimum set of requirements    provide an ample thickening time   ability to set at bottomhole temperatures without requiring external heat   ability to set with a low heat of hydration   provide an acceptable weighing on cement  woc  time   ability to set without freezing   ability to attain adequate compressive strength for the well conditions   provide stability to freeze thaw cycling   other desirable qualities of a permafrost cement system include   ability to be bulk blended and easily handled by field equipment and personnel   provide controlled rheology   provide the ability to be easily mixed in a continuous process at arctic temperatures   have no free water  as with any cementing system  once the slurry is in place  the major consideration of system design becomes long term performance of the cement  in permafrost cementing  considerations are compressive strength

wells      noise logging tool     the noise logging tool  quot listens quot  passively to downhole noise  for example  from gas bubbling up through liquid in the wellbore  behind pipe  a channeling flow often passes through cramped spaces and constrictions  these  quot tight spots quot  cause high velocities  sudden pressure reductions  and significant flow turbulence  the noise tool listens to the noise associated with the turbulence   the tool includes piezoelectric crystals  transducers  which convert the oscillating pressure of wellbore sound to a corresponding oscillating voltage  at the surface  the oscillating voltage is applied to a speaker  permitting the logging operator to hear the downhole sound  the oscillating voltage also is applied to each of four high pass filters  a high pass filter is unresponsive to frequency components of the oscillating voltage that are below the filter   s  quot cutoff quot  frequency  while it generates an oscillating output signal whose amplitude represents the content of the oscillating voltage of frequencies in excess of the cutoff  the cutoff frequencies most often used are                  and       hz      measurement procedures     for quality measurements  the operator stops the tool at a selected depth and waits for extraneous noise  such as the noise generated by tool and logging cable movement  to subside  hurrying contaminates the measurements with extraneous noise  then  a recording system averages and records the amplitude of each filter   s oscillating output signal  subsequently  the tool is moved to a new measurement depth  after waiting for the extraneous noise to subside  the operator initiates the averaging and recording of the amplitudes at the new depth  thus  four values are recorded for each measurement depth  these are plotted in millivolts across the chart at a measurement depth  the amplitude of the     hz filter output is the greatest  as the cutoff frequency increases  the amplitude correspondingly decreases  with the amplitude of the       hz filter output being the least  to form a log  the plotted     hz amplitudes are joined by line segments between successive measurement depths  as are the amplitudes for            and       hz   because a filter   s output signal is oscillatory  it consists of positive excursions from neutral alternating with negative excursions  there are two ways of measuring the amplitude of the output  one measures the amplitude from the peak of a positive excursion to the trough of the following negative excursion  the resulting amplitude is known as  quot peak to peak  quot  and the recording is characterized as  quot standard gain quot  or  quot standard sensitivity  quot  the other amplitude measurement is from the peak of a positive excursion to neutral  with the amplitude being characterized as  quot peak quot  and the recording sensitivity as  quot one half standard gain  quot  other measures are sometimes used   a

completion  a number of logging tools are available to provide information during production operations and beyond  this article discusses the various types of production logs and how they can often be used together to provide crucial information for understanding and resolving problems       production logging     production logging is one of a number of cased hole services that includes cement monitoring  corrosion monitoring  monitoring of formation fluid contacts  and saturations   perforating and plug and packer setting  services performed in dead  overbalanced  conditions can use relatively simple surface pressure control equipment and are often performed using large open hole style logging cables  with a well that has pressure at surface it is normal to use a small logging cable in order to    minimise the tool weight needed to overcome the well pressure trying to extrude the cable   minimise the grease injection requirements to seal around a wireline cable   wells with surface pressure typically have a completion tubing of relatively small internal diameter  id  compared to the casing size across the reservoir  this reduced id means that cased hole toolstrings for live wells are typically sized at         quot  in order to pass through the smallest nipple in a       quot  tubing  it is usual for cased hole equipment manufacturers to produce a platform of sensors with common power supplies  telemetry  or memory  to cover production logging  saturation logging  and multifinger caliper corrosion logging      application of production logs     production logs are used to allocate production on a zone by zone basis and also to diagnose production problems such as leaks or cross flow  these various tasks can be split between those where the target production is into or out of the well and those where the flow never enters the well  typically flow behind pipe  the former is usually easier and more quantitative while the latter is more qualitative      fundamentals of production logging     ideally we would like to measure radial inflow rates using a cheap and accurate sensor  unfortunately no such sensor exists  alternatively we could measure the axial flow rate in a well at a depths above and below the zone of interest and compute the difference and hence the inflow rate  unfortunately there is not any practical measurement of axial flow rate beyond some special applications of oxygen activation logs  however it is possible to measure an axial velocity and combine this with an assumed or measured internal diameter to arrive at an axial flow rate  this last approach is most commonly used  common velocity sensors include    turbine spinner flowmeters   markers tracers such as oxygen activation logs or radioactive iodine tracer logs   heated anenometry  turbines or spinners are assumed to rotate at a speed proportional to the average fluid velocity passing through the swept area of the blades with an offset for friction imperfections  this becomes a simple gain and offset transformation from the rotational speed of the spinner  unfortunately the gain and offset are not constants but are a complicated function of fluid density  fluid viscosity  spinner pitch  pipe diameter  fluid velocity  etc  this means that the spinner is typically calibrated downhole by recording the spinner speed at a series of different logging speeds  usually           ft min or            m min  and plotting the resultant average spinner speed versus the corresponding average logging speed to determine the slope  gain  and threshold  offset   the calibrated spinner velocity then needs to be converted to an average pipe velocity the correction coefficient determined by the velocity profile across the pipe cross section can vary from     for an infinitely small spinner in laminar flow to     for a spinner that sweeps the entire pipe area  n b  the prefix  quot full bore quot  when applied to a spinner is a marketing name  full bore spinners rarely cover more than half the pipe cross section  if the cross sectional area of the spinner at the depth of the spinner blades occupies a significant fraction of the pipe area then the pipe area should be reduced before multiplying it by the spinner velocity and the correction coefficient      categories of applications     production logging tools find many applications from the time a well is drilled until abandonment and  occasionally  beyond polaris production optimization log and reservoir information solutions        houston  baker hughes brochure   an appropriate categorization of production logs is by usage  this approach leads to the five distinct categories listed below that also represent a rough chronological order of tool evolution  effective interpretation of the data from each type of log requires significant education and experience    diagnose production problems

provides an overview of the following conformance improvement systems  polymer waterflooding and treatments  gel treatments  foam flooding and treatments  and resin treatments  this chapter does not discuss improving conformance during oilfield drilling and stimulations operations for which the application of conformance improvement technologies also can be quite advantageous conformance is a measure of the uniformity of the flood front of the injected drive fluid during an oil recovery flooding operation and the uniformity vertically and areally of the flood front as it is being propagated through an oil reservoir  if there were perfect conformance in a perfect regular five spot well pattern during an oil recovery flooding operation  the flood front would reach all four of the offset producers at the same time  and the flood front would reach the entire vertical interval of all four of the producing wells at the same time  of course  there never has been a reservoir that has exhibited perfect conformance during an oil recovery flooding operation  the issues that must be considered are how imperfect is the conformance for a given flooding operation in an oil field

the location of the wellbore is increasingly a  d problem  it is encountered in one of two situations    to direct and define the trajectory of the well during the drilling process  geosteering   to characterize the well path after drilling  the former has contributed to huge increases in well productivity  the latter is a vital element of integrated reservoir studies in which the aim is to generate a  d model of the reservoir based on correct well locations  this discussion is set within the context of the latter  geosteering is a benefit of logging while drilling technology      principles     in directional survey terminology  the azimuth is the orientation of the wellbore to  quot north  quot  which has been variously defined as   magnetic north  geographic north  latitude and longitude   grid north  e g   the universal transverse mercator  utm  geographic coordinate system   azimuth is typically measured clockwise from north  the inclination is the deviation of the wellbore from the vertical  the azimuth and inclination define the coordinates of the wellbore along its length  usually relative to the location of the wellhead  tool face quantifies the direction in which the tool is pointing  it is the angle between a reference direction on a downhole tool and a fixed reference in space  for near vertical wells  the fixed reference is magnetic north and the  magnetic  tool face is the angle between magnetic north and the projection of the tool   s reference direction onto a horizontal plane  for more deviated wells  the fixed reference is the top of the hole and the  gravity or high side  tool face is the tool orientation with respect to the top of the hole  directional surveys allow azimuth and inclination to be determined so that the coordinates of well location can be computed at each survey station      measurement     there are two types of directional surveys  magnetic and gyroscope surveys  traditionally  each of these has been run using either single  or multishot tools  the tools are self contained and can be powered from the surface or with downhole batteries  for a detailed description  see bourgoyne   et al   bourgoyne  a t

conducting cable  after drilling  they are openhole measurements  in the simplest form  a magnetic survey tool comprises a downhole inclinometer and a compass unit  more advanced tools comprise arrays of three axis accelerometers  inclinometers  and magnetometers  a three axis accelerometer measures three orthogonal components of gravity  which combine vectorially to give the direction of the earth   s gravitational field relative to the axis of the tool and a reference position on its circumference  a three axis magnetometer measures the direction of the earth   s magnetic field relative to the tool axis  as    fig      illustrates  by combining the accelerometer and magnetometer data  it is possible to calculate the inclination    i    and azimuth    a    of the tool  through the tool face  it is then possible to calculate the inclination          and azimuth          of the wellbore itself  the magnetic measurements are impacted by short term variations in the earth   s magnetic field and by proximity to magnetic materials such as drillpipe and casing or to magnetic minerals such as pyrite and or hematite  the latter also occurring as a mud additive  these problems can be mitigated through the use of nonmagnetic drill collars and repeat measurements with different alignments of the tool in the wellbore  it should be noted that even where magnetic survey tools are run in long lengths of nonmagnetic drill collars  there can still be a significant effect from steel drillstring tools thorogood  j l        directional survey operations management  j pet technol

stresses  see directional survey errors for more information  for this reason  gyroscope surveys have to be run on wireline  usually while entering the hole with a few additional checkshots on coming out  they interrupt the drilling process  and this adds to cost  however  they can be run in cased hole  in the simplest form  a gyro tool comprises a downhole inclinometer and gyroscope unit

of a time invariant rock compressibility   cr     spatially constant or variable  in reality  rock mechanics is intimately coupled with fluid flow   rock mechanics is coupled with fluid flow in two aspects    porosity changes are a direct result of the deformation of the skeleton  which is a complex function of both pressure and stress  effective stress state   permeability of the media is also a function of effective stresses in the reservoir   therefore  rigorous reservoir simulation should include simultaneous solution of multiphase flow and stresses as well as the appropriate dependencies between these processes  while these couplings physically exist to some extent in all reservoirs  they can be often ignored or approximated when the reservoir behaves elastically  however  the changes in porosity and permeability are more pronounced when rock failure occurs  such as in compacting reservoirs or in high pressure injection operations  and these processes require use of more complex  coupled geomechanical modeling      types of coupling     there are essentially two main types of coupling between reservoir flow and stress    pore volume coupling  flow properties

pressures are generated  and these pressures are called swab pressures  in most wells  the magnitude of the pressure surges is not critical because proper casing design and mud programs leave large enough margins between fracture pressures and formation fluid pressures  typically  dynamic fluid flow is not a consideration  so a steady state calculation can be performed  a certain fraction of wells  however  cannot be designed with large surge pressure margins  in these critical wells  pressure surges must be maintained within narrow limits  in other critical wells  pressure margins may be

separator quot  in petroleum terminology designates a pressure vessel used for separating well fluids produced from oil gas wells into gaseous and liquid components  separation is required for stage recovery of liquid hydrocarbons  producing saleable oil and gas streams  well testing  metering  and protection of pumps and compressors     separators are required to provide oil gas streams that meet saleable pipeline specifications  as well as a water solids stream for disposal  typically  the oil must have less than     by volume  water and less than   lbm water mmscf gas  the water stream must have less than    ppm oil for overboard discharge in the gulf of mexico  gom   staged separation  depressurization  is required to maximize the liquid hydrocarbon volumes        fig         shows

quot trap quot  refer to a conventional oil gas separator  these separating vessels are normally used on a producing lease or platform near a wellhead  manifold  or tank battery to separate fluids produced from oil gas wells into oil gas or liquid gas  they must be capable of handling  quot slugs quot  or  quot heads quot  of well fluids  therefore  they are usually sized to handle the highest instantaneous rates of flow     a knockout vessel  drum  or trap may be used to remove only water from the well fluid or to remove all liquid  oil plus water  from the gas  in the case of a water knockout for use near the wellhead  the gas and liquid petroleum are usually discharged together  and the free water is separated and discharged from the bottom of the vessel     a liquid knockout is also used to remove all liquid  oil plus water  from the gas  the water and liquid hydrocarbons are discharged together from the bottom of the vessel  and the gas is discharged from the top     a flash chamber  trap or vessel  normally refers to a conventional oil gas separator operated at low pressure  with the liquid from a higher pressure separator being partially vaporized or  quot flashed quot  into it  this flash chamber is quite often the second or third stage of separation  with the liquid being discharged from the flash chamber to storage     an expansion vessel is the first stage separator on a low temperature or cold separation unit  this vessel may be equipped with a heating coil to melt hydrates

although direct far field techniques can be used to map hydraulic fractures  the technology is still under development  when the technology is used in a field  the data and knowledge gained are often used on subsequent wells to spread out the costs  knowing the fracture orientation is useful in planning field development and in optimizing future fracture treatments      direct near wellbore techniques     direct near wellbore techniques are run in the well that is being fracture treated to locate or image the portion of fracture that is very near  within inches of  the wellbore  direct near wellbore techniques consist of tracer  temperature  production  borehole image  downhole video  and caliper logs  if a hydraulic fracture intersects the wellbore  these direct near wellbore techniques can be of some benefit in locating the hydraulic fracture   however  these near wellbore techniques are not unique and cannot supply information on the size or shape of the fracture once the fracture is two to three wellbore diameters in distance from the wellbore  in naturally fractured reservoirs  in which multiple fractures are likely to exist  the reliability of direct near wellbore techniques are even more speculative  as such  direct near wellbore techniques are used only to find where the hydraulic fracture exited the wellbore and to map the fracture that is essentially connected directly to the wellbore      indirect fracture techniques     indirect fracture techniques consist of    hydraulic fracture modeling of net pressures  pressure transient test analyses  production data analyses  because the fracture treatment data and the post fracture production data are normally available on every well  the indirect fracture diagnostic techniques are the

pumping system is made up of several components  some of which operate aboveground and other parts of which operate underground  down in the well  the surface pumping unit  which drives the underground pump  consists of a prime mover  usually an electric motor  and  normally  a beam fixed to a pivotal post  the post is called a sampson post  and the beam is normally called a walking beam

forth  moving the downhole components up and down in the process  the entire surface system is run by a prime mover  v belt drives  and a gearbox with a crank mechanism on it  when this type of system is used  it is usually called a beam pump installation  however  other types of surface pumping units can be used  including hydraulically actuated units  with and without some type of counterbalancing system   or even tall tower systems that use a chain or belt to allow long strokes and slow pumping speeds  the more generic name of sucker rod lift  or sucker rod pumping  should be used to refer to all types of reciprocating rod lift methods   linked rods attached to an underground pump are connected to the surface unit  the linked rods are normally called sucker rods and are usually long steel rods  from     to more than   or       in  in diameter  the steel rods are normally screwed together in     or    ft lengths  however  rods could be welded into one piece that would become a continuous length from the surface to the downhole pump  the steel sucker rods typically fit inside the tubing and are stroked up and down by the surface pumping unit  this activates the downhole  positive displacement pump at the bottom of the well  each time the rods and pumps are stroked  a volume of produced fluid is lifted through the sucker rod tubing annulus and discharged at the surface      selecting the sucker rod pumping method     many factors must be considered when determining the most appropriate lift system for a particular well  artificial lift selection methods presents a discussion of the normally available artificial lift techniques  their advantages and disadvantages  and the selection of a method for a well installation   sucker rod pumping systems should be considered for new  lower volume stripper wells  because they have proved to be cost effective over time  operating personnel usually are familiar with these mechanically simple systems and can operate them efficiently  inexperienced personnel also can operate rod pumps more effectively than other types of artificial lift  most of these systems have a high salvage value   because of its long history of successfully lifting well fluids  the sucker rod lift method is normally considered the first choice

arm  or   arm oriented caliper logs or using electrical or acoustic images  whether obtained by wireline or logging while drilling  lwd  tools  in fact  with the advent of density and porosity lwd imaging tools  it is now possible to identify and orient wellbore failures while drilling   because mechanical calipers are still the most widely used tool in detecting breakouts  and because of the large amount of available data  a considerable amount of work has been carried out using data from these devices to identify stress orientations and their variations with depth and location  the results  when careful filtering criteria are used  indicate that stress orientations vary slowly with both depth and location  the exceptions are in cases of active faulting  rapid drawdown of

that intersect the well and are activated by a near wellbore pore pressure increase caused by infiltration owing to the mud overbalance during drilling          using seismic anisotropy     it has long been known that elastic wave velocities are a function of stress  that is  velocity will increase with confining pressure  as shown in    fig       rai  c s  and hanson  k e        shear wave

sedimentary rocks  geophysics                   it has also been demonstrated that this is owing to the presence of microcracks and pores that close in response to applied load  the amount of change of velocity with stress depends both on the number of cracks and on their compliances  as the load increases and the most compliant cracks close  the sensitivity of velocity to confining pressure decreases  once all cracks are closed  velocities change very little with stress  and under sufficiently high confining stress  it is possible to measure the    intrinsic velocities    of a sample

rocks are intrinsically anisotropic and can also be anisotropic due to structural fabric such as joints or bedding planes  it is important to differentiate between stress induced and intrinsic or structural anisotropy  this is rarely possible  except in cases in which the geological structures can be identified and their effects quantified and removed from the data prior to analysis  it is also possible to identify stress induced anisotropy when the characteristics of the anisotropy that is stress induced differ from

completion and a well that is an economic and engineering success  improper size selection can result in holes so small that the well must be abandoned because of drilling or completion problems  the drilling engineer  and well planner  is responsible for designing the hole geometry to avoid these problems   however  a successful well is not necessarily an economic success  for example  a well design that allows for satisfactory  trouble free drilling and completion may be an economic failure  because the drilling costs are greater than the expected return on investment  hole geometry selection is a part of the engineering plan that can make the difference between economic and engineering failure or success      general design procedures     the drilling industry   s experience has developed several commonly used hole geometry programs  these programs are based on bit  and casing size availability as well as the expected drilling conditions   deep  high pressure wells often require deviations from common geometries  reasons include    prolific production rates requiring large tubing strings   drilling problems requiring the use of an intermediate string and one or more liners   tension design problems because thick walled pipe must be used to control burst or collapse   rig limitations in running heavy strings of pipe   because deep  high pressure wells are being drilled with increasing frequency  careful attention must be given to hole sizing       bottom to top approach      the highest priority in well planning should be developing a design that provides for economic production from the pay zone  even in exploratory drilling for geological investigations  a large hole may be necessary for thorough formation evaluation  the pay zone should be analyzed with respect to its flow potential and the drilling problems that will be encountered in reaching it       flow string sizing      the flow  or tubing  string must be given consideration relative to its ability to conduct oil gas to surface at economical rates  small diameter tubing restricts  or chokes  flow rates because of high friction pressures   completion problems can be more complicated with small tubing and casing  the reduced radial clearances make tool placement and operations more difficult  and workover activities are more complicated   typical well designs are shown in    fig        the geometries in parts  a  and  c  use large diameter tubing  the small tubing string  b  will probably restrict the fluid flow from the producing zone  in addition  the design in  b  will

  fig             size selection problems     many interrelated size selection problems must be considered before the final hole geometry is established  these problems primarily relate to casing size

magnitudes and orientations  the pore pressure  and the rock properties  it is possible to predict the amount of wellbore instability as a function of mud weight and properties  this makes it possible to reduce drilling costs by keeping lost time low and by designing wells just carefully enough to minimize problems without excessive cost  a further benefit of considering geomechanical risk is that when problems are encountered  their causes can be recognized and plans can be in place to mitigate their effects with minimal disruption of the drilling schedule      overview        fig       shows the time depth plot of an offshore well that was designed and drilled without the use of geomechanical modeling  after setting the first string to isolate a shallow hazard  the remaining casing depth points were selected based on drilling experience in an offset block  supplemented by pore pressures predicted using seismic data  considerable problems were experienced because of the length of the fourth casing interval  subsequent geomechanical analysis revealed that the fourth casing interval was too long because the second and third casing strings were set too shallow  the dark dashed line on    fig       representing afe   a new casing design was subsequently developed based on the geomechanical analysis that mitigated the problem with the fourth casing string and led to a

because the geomechanical parameters  stress  pore pressure  and strength  are largely out of our control  there are a limited number of things that can be done to minimize geomechanical stability problems  options include    one  as illustrated in    fig        is to optimize the locations of casing seats   another is to optimize mud weight and drilling parameters  minimizing swab and surge while running pipe and maintaining an appropriate pumping rate to keep equivalent circulating density  ecd  low  in situations where it is necessary to maintain a close tolerance   other options include changing the well trajectory  where that is possible   or at least identifying those trajectories that are least likely to cause drilling problems  an example in which this is particularly valuable is in drilling moderate reach wells where there is a choice in the depth  length  and inclination of deviated hole sections   it may also be possible by use of appropriate drilling fluids to increase the pressure required to propagate hydraulic fractures  thereby reducing the leakoff pressure  and recent developments reveal that it may be possible also to increase the leakoff pressure by changing near wellbore conditions with use of special materials or by heating the well   to maximize the number of options  geomechanical design constraints should be developed as early as possible in the life of a field  particularly in cases in which development will be carried out from a small number of fixed locations  this way  recovery can be maximized with the smallest number of wells drilled along risky trajectories and the lowest facilities cost      predicting failure in wells of any orientation        fig       shows how wellbore stability in wells of all orientations can be

are reciprocating pumps and jet pumps  this page discusses each pump type along with a few operational considerations      reciprocating pumps     the pump end of a hydraulic downhole pump is similar to a sucker rod pump because it uses a rod actuated plunger  also called the pump piston  and two or more check valves  the pump can be either single acting or double acting  a single acting pump closely follows rod pump design practices and is called single acting because it displaces fluid on either the upstroke or downstroke  but not both   an example is shown schematically in    fig           fig       shows a double acting pump that has suction and discharge valves for both sides of the plunger  which enables it to displace fluids to the surface on both the upstroke and downstroke  with either system  motion of the plunger away from a suction valve lowers the pressure that holds the valve closed  it opens as the pressure drops  and well fluids are allowed to enter the barrel or cylinder  at the end of the stroke  the plunger reverses  forcing the suction valve to close and opening the discharge valving    file vol  page     image      png    fig    hydraulic piston single

extends to the surface of the well and connects to the pumping unit  however  in hydraulic pumps  the rod is quite short and extends only to the engine pistons  the engine piston is constructed similarly to the pump plunger and is exposed to the power fluid supply that is under the control of the engine valve  the engine valve reverses the flow of the power fluid on alternate half strokes and causes the engine piston to reciprocate back and forth  four way engine valves are used with engines that switch from high pressure to low pressure power fluid exhaust on both sides of the engine piston in an alternate manner  these engine  or reversing  valves are used with double acting pump ends to give equal force on both upstroke and downstroke  three way engine valves are used with unequal area engine pistons that always have high pressure power fluid on one side and switch the power fluid from high to low pressure on the other face of the piston  this type of reversing valve is commonly used with single acting pumps that do not require a high force on the half stroke because it is not displacing produced fluid to the surface  an example of this type of engine attached to a single acting pump is illustrated in    fig          file vol  page     image      png    fig    three way engine valve with single acting hydraulic pump       the engine or reversing valve can be activated by several methods  commonly  ports on a rod direct pressure to control the engine valve at the extremes of the upstroke and downstroke  causing the valve to shift hydraulically  the shifting of the engine valve redirects the flow of power fluid to the engine piston and causes the reversal of the rod and plunger system  alternatively  the engine can be mechanically  quot bumped quot  from one position to the other by the rod and plunger system as it nears the end of the upstroke and downstroke  combinations of mechanical and hydraulic shifting are possible  and the engine valve may be located above the rod and plunger system  in the middle of the pump  or in the engine piston   note that the two designs illustrated and discussed do not exhaust the design possibilities offered by the various pump manufacturers  many combinations are possible  and tandem pumps or engine sections are sometimes advantageous  examples of combinations of these design concepts can be seen in the cross section schematics of the various pump types that accompany the pump specifications in    tables   through       which show the producing abilities and other factors that should be considered in designing reciprocating pumps  in the past  many tables were used in choosing the correct pump for the application  but today  the use of computers eliminates the errors inherent in reading charts and tables  making the process much simpler  common to all designs  however  is the concept of a reversing valve that causes an engine piston  or pistons  to reciprocate back and forth

effectively in a diverse range of applications  as with other artificial lift systems  the basic objective in the design of a pcp system is to select system components and operating parameters  e g   pump speed  that can achieve the desired fluid production rates while not exceeding the mechanical performance capabilities of the equipment components to facilitate optimal service life and system value  when a pcp system is designed for a particular application  both the system components and operating environment must be considered to ensure that a suitable system design is achieved      overview of the design process        fig       presents a    design process    flow chart that outlines the many factors and considerations that should be addressed in the selection of an effective overall system configuration and operating strategy  at each step  the designer selects certain operating parameters or specific equipment components and must then assess the impacts of these decisions on system performance  for example  selection of a particular tubing size is based on such design considerations as flow losses and casing size  some considerations apply to more than one decision  as is the case with flow losses that affect pump  tubing  and rod string selection  other design considerations may produce conflicting results  which complicates the decision making process  for example  the use of rod string centralizers may minimize wear but may also increase flow losses  as with other artificial lift systems  the design process is generally iterative  and individual parameters are often adjusted to achieve an optimal design for a particular application  as    fig       shows  the primary design considerations for a pcp system are    file vol  page     image      png    fig      flowchart illustrating the design process for pcp systems        pump selection and sizing  fluid flow effects and considerations  rod loading  rod fatigue  power transmission selection  the first step in the design process is to gather information for the application of interest  past experience  fluid properties  production  well records  and reservoir data are all useful sources of relevant information  next  it is necessary to determine the anticipated fluid rates  these can be estimated from historical data or by setting a dynamic fluid level and calculating production rates based on reservoir data and an inflow performance relationship vogel  j v   inflow performance relationships for solution gas drive wells     jpt            initial values must then be set for the    wellbore geometry  pump seating location  dynamic fluid level  tubing size  rod string configuration  if the design is for an existing well  some of these parameters may already be constrained   once these equipment and operating parameters are established  flow losses can be calculated  if the estimated flow losses are unacceptably high  they can be reduced by increasing the tubing size  reducing the rod string induced flow restrictions  or decreasing the fluid rate  next  initial values for pump intake and discharge pressures  net lift  pump speed  and pump displacement can be set  this allows the designer to select a range of pump models capable of satisfying the desired pump displacement and lift requirements  however  if there are no pumps available that meet both requirements  then the prescribed pump displacement and lift specifications must be relaxed by decreasing the fluid rate expectations  increasing pump speed  reducing discharge pressure requirements  increasing pump intake pressure  or by implementing some combination of these changes  the individual pumps that satisfy the requirements are then evaluated on the basis of geometric design and fluid considerations to select the most appropriate pump model   once a specific pump model has been selected  rod loading  rod string tubing wear  and surface equipment requirements can be evaluated  if the calculated rod stresses exceed the allowable value  then either the rod string strength must be increased through the use of a larger rod or higher strength material  or the loading must be

taken to reduce axial loads  e g   use of a smaller pump   or the rod string must be reconfigured so that it is less prone to wear  after the rod loading and wear considerations are satisfied  the final step in the design process is the selection of surface equipment  if the available surface equipment cannot meet the polished rod power requirements  then the design process must be repeated to configure a downhole system or operating parameters that result in reduced system loads  for example  reduced power requirements

extends away from the   t   axis in a perpendicular plane to intersect the helically shaped complex seismic trace    z t     the length of this vector is the amplitude of the complex trace at that

fluids to flow efficiently or to permit installation of effective artificial lift equipment  a tubing string that is too small causes large friction losses and limits production  it also may severely restrict the type and size of artificial lift equipment  a tubing string that is too large may cause heading and unstable flow  which results in loading up of the well and can complicate workovers

continuous length tubular products used in modern ct services      birth of coiled tubing technology     the origins of continuous length  steel tubing technology can be traced to engineering and fabrication work pioneered by allied engineering teams during the second world war  project     code named  quot pluto quot   an acronym for pipe lines under the ocean   was a top secret allied invasion enterprise involving the deployment of pipelines from the coast of england to several points along the coast of france  the   in  inside diameter  id  continuous length pipelines were wound upon massive hollow conundrums  which were used to spool up the entire length of individual pipeline segments  the reported dimensions of the conundrums were    ft in width  flange to flange   a core diameter of    ft  and a flange diameter of    ft  these conundrums were designed to be sufficiently buoyant with a full spool of pipeline to enable deployment when towed behind cable laying ships  six of the    pipelines deployed across the english channel were constructed of   in  id steel pipe        in  wall thickness   the   in  id steel pipelines  described as  quot hamel pipe  quot  were fabricated by butt welding    ft lengths of pipe into approximately       ft segments of pipeline  these       ft segments were then butt welded together and spooled onto the conundrums  a total of             gallons of petrol was reported to have been delivered to the allied armies through pluto pipelines at a rate of more than   million gal d hartley  a c        operation pluto  in the civil

cables to provide the axial load support for the weight of the hose and bottomhole drilling assembly  the hose coupling cable attachment clamps were also designed to allow removal of the steel cables

that produce mainly dry natural gas  many of the low permeability reservoirs that have been developed in the past are sandstone  but significant quantities of gas are also produced from low permeability carbonates  shales  and coal seams  production of gas from coal seams is covered in a separate chapter in this handbook  in this chapter  production of gas from tight sandstones is the predominant theme  however  much of the same technology applies to tight carbonate and to gas shale reservoirs tight gas reservoirs have one thing in common   a vertical well drilled and completed in the tight gas reservoir must be successfully stimulated to produce at commercial gas flow rates and produce commercial gas volumes  normally  a large hydraulic fracture treatment is required to produce gas economically  in some naturally fractured tight gas reservoirs  horizontal wells and or multilateral wells can be used to provide the stimulation required for commerciality to optimize the development of a tight gas reservoir  the geoscientists and engineers must optimize the number of wells drilled  as well as the drilling and completion procedures for each well  often  more data and more engineering manpower are required to understand and develop tight gas reservoirs than are required for higher permeability  conventional reservoirs  on an individual well basis  a well in a tight gas reservoir will produce less gas over a longer period of time than one expects from a well completed in a higher permeability  conventional reservoir  as such  many more wells  or smaller well spacing  must be drilled in a tight gas reservoir to recover a large percentage of the original gas in place  ogip   when compared to a conventional reservoir in this chapter  we discuss all aspects of data collection and the analyses required to evaluate and develop tight gas reservoirs  many more details can be found in the referenced papers and books  __toc__     definition of tight gas     in the     s  the united states government decided that the definition of a tight gas reservoir is one in which the expected value of permeability to gas flow would be less than     md  this definition was a political definition that has been used to determine which wells would receive federal and or state tax credits for producing gas from tight reservoirs  actually  the definition of a tight gas reservoir is a function of many factors  each relating to darcy s law rtenotitle                         the main problem with tight gas reservoirs is that they do not produce at economic flow rates unless they are stimulated   normally by a large hydraulic fracture treatment     eq         illustrates the main factors controlling flow rate     eq         clearly shows that the flow rate    q    is a function of permeability   k    net pay thickness   h    average reservoir pressure p    flowing pressure   p    wf    fluid properties          drainage area   r    e    wellbore radius   r    w    and skin factor   s    thus  to choose a single value of permeability to define  quot tight gas quot  is not wise  in deep  high pressure  thick reservoirs  excellent completions can be achieved when the formation permeability to gas is in the microdarcy range        md   in shallow  low pressure  thin reservoirs  permeabilities of several millidarcies  might be required to produce the gas at economic flow rates  even after a successful fracture treatment the best way to define tight gas is that  quot the reservoir cannot be produced at economic flow rates nor recover economic volumes of natural gas unless a special technique is used to stimulate production  quot  specifically  large hydraulic fracture treatments  a horizontal wellbore  or multilateral wellbores must be used to stimulate flow rates and increase the recovery efficiency in the reservoir so what is a typical tight gas reservoir  there are no  quot typical quot  tight gas reservoirs  they can be deep or shallow  high pressure or low pressure  high temperature or low temperature  blanket or lenticular  homogeneous or naturally fractured  and single layered or multilayered the optimum drilling  completion and stimulation methods for each well are a function of the reservoir characteristics and the economic situation  some tight gas reservoirs are in south texas  while others are in the deserts of egypt  the costs to drill  complete and stimulate the wells  plus the gas price and the gas market affect how tight gas reservoirs are developed  as with all engineering problems  the technology used is a function of the economic conditions surrounding the project      the resource triangle     the concept of the resource triangle was used by masters and grey to find a large gas field and build a

after it has been fracture treated  the engineer should analyze the productivity index of the well both before and after the fracture treatment  other factors of importance are ultimate oil and gas recovery and calculations to determine the propped fracture length  the fracture conductivity  and the drainage area of the well  post fracture treatment analyses of the fracture treatment data  the production data  and the pressure data can be very complicated and time consuming  however  without adequate post fracture evaluation  it will be impossible to continue the fracture treatment optimization process on subsequent wells      productivity index increase     many of the early treatments in the     s were designed to increase the productivity index of damaged wells  these treatments were normally pumped to break through damage in moderate  to high permeability wells  the productivity index of an oil well is  rtenotitle                         for a gas well

page     image      png    fig      mcguire and sikora graph       the mcguire and sikora graph can be used to draw the following conclusions    for high permeability reservoirs  fracture conductivity is more important than fracture length   for low permeability reservoirs  fracture length is more important than fracture conductivity   for a given fracture length  there is an optimum value of conductivity ratio   most fracture treatments in undamaged formations should result in stimulation ratios of   to      these conclusions have allowed engineers to design successful fracture treatments

prats explained that a well with a fracture half length of     ft will produce as if the well had been drilled with a     ft diameter drill bit  in other words  the hydraulic fracture  if conductive enough  acts to extend the wellbore and stimulate flow rate from the well  if the dimensionless fracture conductivity    c    fd    eq      is equal to    or greater  the hydraulic fracture will essentially act as if it is an infinitely conductive fracture   rtenotitle                              ultimate recovery for fractured wells     hydraulic fracturing should always increase the productivity index of a well  and  under certain circumstances  the hydraulic fracture can increase the ultimate recovery     figs    and      illustrate the differences that sometimes occur between low permeability and high permeability reservoirs  in    fig        when a high permeability well is fracture treated  the drainage volume and the recovery efficiency in the reservoir are not significantly altered  the fracture treatment increases the flow rate  increases the decline rate  and decreases the producing life of the well  the ultimate recovery is not changed  the same reserves are recovered in a shorter period of time  which reduces overall operating costs  accelerating the recovery of a fixed volume of reserves is often beneficial  if the well is located in the arctic or offshore in deep water  where operating costs are very high  then recovering the reserves sooner is very advantageous    file vol prt page     image      png    fig      production behavior in a high

 quot fullbore quot  spinner  in the case of the fullbore  the spinner element folds into a diameter no greater than that of the tool when in the tubing  but expands into a larger diameter for surveying in the casing  the continuous spinner does not have this capability  the difference between the two is too small to justify a separate discussion of each   the continuous meter derives its name from the need to move the tool fast enough to overcome frictional torque and start the spinner element rotating  it also derives its name from the in situ calibration procedure that uses logging runs at several different cable speeds with the well shut in at the surface  neither continuous nor fullbore  however  can provide a log that is quantitative whenever the fluid velocity is sporadic  that is  changing in the logged interval      features     the continuous and fullbore tools share three features    first  the spinner element on each is at the very bottom of the tool string  if the temperature tool is run in combination with the spinner  then the thermometer   s sensor will usually be located in the tool string above the spinner  thus  the sensor will be   to   ft above the bottom of the string  moreover  this   to   ft will include at least one centralizer  the mixing caused by the passage of the centralizer in front of the temperature sensor will decrease the vertical resolution of the temperature log by a few ft  even so  the vertical resolution of the temperature tool to localized entries is still far superior to that of the spinner tool  and the temperature tool should be included in the tool string   the second common feature is the presence of at least two centralizers in any tool string containing the spinner flowmeter  the centralizers ensure that the spinner element samples the same location in the wellbore   s cross section at each depth  this consistency is necessary for the same tool calibration to apply at each depth and for the relative profile to be representative of flow rates   the third shared feature is that both tools use a four blade propeller type  or turbine type  spinner element  although the design of the spinner element may vary  the four blade feature is retained   the spinner element can rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise  as viewed down the tool barrel   the direction of rotation depends upon the movement of the fluid relative to the barrel of the tool  that is  upon the direction of fluid movement as seen by  quot rider quot  on the tool  usually  the pitch of the spinner is such that relative movement of fluid up the barrel causes the spinner to turn clockwise  whereas relative movement of fluid down the barrel causes a counterclockwise rotation of the spinner  consequently  movement of the tool downward in stagnant fluid causes relative movement of fluid up the barrel and rotates the spinner clockwise  movement upward in a stagnant fluid causes relative fluid movement down the tool barrel and spins the element in a counterclockwise direction  movement of the tool in a direction opposite to the direction of flow causes the spinner to turn in the sam direction  clockwise or counterclockwise  throughout the logged interval including those intervals with stagnant fluid  passes made downward in a production well therefore cause a clockwise rotation over the interval from      to    flow  passes made upward in an injection well cause a counterclockwise rotation  on the other hand  movement of the tool in the direction of flow at a line speed less than full steam velocity causes a reversal in the direction of spinner rotation at some depth within the flow interval  the spinner first loses speed as flow velocity approaches tool speed  it then stops when fluid velocity reaches tool speed less the frictional threshold speed for the tool  the spinner remains stopped until fluid velocity changes by an amount that equals two threshold values  at which point the spinner begins to turn again  but in a direction opposite the previous one  as fluid velocity changes further  the spinner maintains its opposite rotational direction  such a pass should not be used for percentage flow profiling  because two threshold values are  quot lost quot  in the record of spin rate   many spinners  however  do not record the direction of rotation  even worse  some spinners have lower sensitivities when rotating counterclockwise  in event the direction of rotation changes and the spinner does not record it  the change can be recognized from its signature  a drop of the revolutions per second  rps  to zero  followed by a resumption of the rps to above zero values      application and interpretation     both continuous and fullbore tools are intended for quantitative use only in flow streams having a single component of velocity directed along the axis of the tool  furthermore  the strea

to determine whether the reservoir meets the minimum technical and economic criteria for a successful waterflood  if so  then more detailed technical calculations are made  these include the full range of engineering and geoscience studies   the geologists must develop as complete an understanding as possible of the internal character of the pay intervals and of the continuity of nonpay intervals  this preflood understanding often is limited because the injector producer wells connectivity has not been determined quantitatively  interference testing can provide insight into connectivity when its cost is justifiable  data gathered from smart wells can be particularly helpful in determining connectivity in high cost environments where there is a limited number of wellbores  analogs also can prove useful  otherwise  little definitive data will be available until after there has been significant fluid movement from the injectors toward the producers   the engineer will make a number of reservoir calculations to determine the well spacing and pattern style that will be used in a particular flood  these choices are based on the available understanding of the reservoir geology  the proposed design of surface facilities  particularly water injection volumes   and any potential limits on the numbers of injectors and producers  such factors are interrelated in terms of capital and operating costs and oil   water   and gas producing rates to define the overall economics of the project  in making these preliminary calculations  facility capacities need to be flexible because as the waterflood progresses  there almost certainly will be modifications to the original designs and operating plans   in this article  a number of waterflood design considerations will be

the individual seismic traces prior to stacking  in a prestack analysis  the most common of these is the variation of amplitude with offset  or amplitude vs  offset  avo    which is often used as an indicator of fluid type  the interpretation of any attribute is nonunique  and calibration to well data is required to minimize the ambiguities present      well calibration     calibration of seismic

is simple to correlate the attribute of interest with the well log  or log derived  data of interest  a strong correlation between seismic amplitude and porosity is often enough to convince many

immiscible gas injection projects have been undertaken  some with excellent results and others with poor performance   this page discusses gas injection into oil reservoirs to increase oil recovery by immiscible displacement  the use of gas  either of a designed composition or at high enough pressure  to result in the miscible displacement of oil is not discussed here  for a discussion of that topic  see miscible injection enhanced oil recovery  eor       overview     gas injection projects are undertaken when and where there is a readily available supply of gas  this gas supply typically comes from produced solution gas or gas cap gas  gas produced from a deeper gas filled reservoir  or gas from a relatively close gas field  such projects take a variety of forms  including the following    reinjection of produced gas into existing gas caps overlying producing oil columns   injection into oil reservoirs of separated produced gas for pressure maintenance  for gas storage  or as required by government regulations   gas injection to prevent migration of oil into a gas cap because of a natural waterdrive  downdip water injection  or both   gas injection to increase recoveries from reservoirs containing volatile  high shrinkage oils and into gas cap reservoirs containing retrograde gas condensate   gas injection into very undersaturated oil reservoirs for the purpose of swelling the oil and hence increasing oil recovery   the primary physical mechanisms that occur as a result of gas injection are    partial or complete maintenance of reservoir pressure  displacement of oil by gas both horizontally and vertically  vaporization of the liquid hydrocarbon components from the oil column and possibly from the gas cap if retrograde condensation has occurred or if the original gas cap contains a relict oil saturation  swelling of the oil if the oil at original reservoir conditions was very undersaturated with gas  gas injection is particularly effective in high relief reservoirs where the process is called  quot gravity drainage quot  because the vertical gravity aspects increase the efficiency of the process and enhance recovery of updip oil residing above the uppermost oil zone perforations      application     the decision to apply immiscible gas injection is based on a combination of technical and economic factors  deferral of gas sales is a significant economic deterrent for many potential gas injection projects if an outlet for immediate gas sales is available  nevertheless  a variety of opportunities still exist  first are those reservoirs with characteristics and conditions particularly conducive to gas oil gravity drainage and where attendant high oil recoveries are possible  second are those reservoirs where decreased depletion time resulting from lower reservoir oil viscosity and gas saturation in the vicinity of producing wells is more attractive economically than alternative recovery methods that have higher ultimate recovery potential but at higher costs  and third are reservoirs where recovery considerations are augmented by gas storage considerations and hence gas sales may be delayed for

methods to determine pore pressure         equivalent depth methods      one example of analysis using a trend line is the equivalent depth method illustrated in    fig        this method first assumes that there is a depth section over which the pore pressure is hydrostatic  and the sediments are normally compacted because of the systematic increase in effective stress with depth  when the log of a measured value is plotted as a function of depth  ncts can be displayed as straight lines fitted to the data over the normally compacted interval  because the value of the measured physical

     illustration of the equivalent depth method using sonic   t  the normal compaction trend  nct  is a straight line in log linear space that has been fitted to the decrease in slowness as a function of depth where sediments are normally compacting  the effective stress at depth   z   is equal to the effective stress at depth   a    and thus  the pore pressure at depth   z   is simply   p

normal compaction trend at which the measured parameter is the same as it is at the depth of interest  the only unique assumption required by equivalent depth methods is that effective stress is a linear function of depth       the ratio method      in the ratio method  pore pressure is calculated using the assumption that  for sonic delta t  density  and resistivity  respectively  the pore pressure is the product of the normal pressure multiplied  or divided by  the ratio of the measured value to the normal value for the same depth   rtenotitle  and  rtenotitle

pressure  calibration of this method requires knowing the appropriate normal value of each parameter  it is important to realize that  in contrast to trend line methods  the ratio method does not use overburden or effective stress explicitly and thus is not an effective stress method  this can lead to unphysical situations  such as calculated pore pressures that are higher than the overburden  the ratio method is also applied to analyses of pore pressure from the drilling exponent     fig        mouchet  j p  and mitchell  a        abnormal pressures while drilling  origins  prediction

changed for different regions so that the predictions better match pore pressures inferred from other data   the major problem with all trend line methods is that the user must pick the correct normal

disturbed  tar must not be removed if it occurs naturally in situ  and nacl pore linings must not be removed if it occurs naturally in situ  gypsum  when present  must not be dehydrated during the determination of porosity  and hydroxyl water of clay minerals must not be removed and counted as part of the pore space  pore space must not be created during the cleaning process by flowing large volumes of fluid through rocks with soluble grains  such as gypsum  anhydrite  limestone  or salt   another pitfall to avoid is that some rock samples are mechanically weak and uncompact when brought to the surface and freed from the overburden load  these rock samples must be returned to in situ conditions of effective stress to return the rock sample to its in situ value of porosity  correct

stressed and unstressed measurements on a given rock type can be used to extrapolate to a larger data set   an additional pitfall is that some sandstones contain fibrous pore bridging clay minerals  these clay types are fragile and are damaged by most routine methods used to clean the core before porosity determination  when this type of clay is determined to be present  all subsequent core

comparable estimates in vertical wells  further  it is much more difficult to interpret well test data because of  d flow geometry  the radial symmetry usually present in a vertical well does not exist  several flow regimes can potentially occur and need to be considered in analyzing test data from horizontal wells  wellbore storage effects can be much more significant and partial penetration and end effects commonly complicate interpretation   in vertical wells  variables such as average permeability  net vertical thickness  and skin are used  horizontal wells need more detail  not only is vertical thickness important  but the horizontal dimensions of the reservoir  relative to the horizontal wellbore  need to be known      steps in evaluating horizontal well test data     there are three basic steps in evaluating pressure transient data from a horizontal well    identify the specific flow regimes in the test data  apply the proper analytical and graphical procedures to the data  evaluate the uniqueness and sensitivity of the results to properties derived from analysis or simply assumed      identify flow regimes      evaluation of data from a vertical wellbore will generally center on a single flow regime  such as infinite acting radial flow  known as the mtr  however  a pressure transient test in a horizontal well can involve as many as five major and distinct regimes that need to be identified  these regimes may or may not occur in a given test and may or may not be obscured by wellbore storage effects       apply the proper procedures      each flow regime can be modeled by an equation that can be used to estimate important reservoir properties  at best  only groups of analytical parameters can be determined directly from equations  it is imperative that the proper analytical and graphical procedures be applied to the data  in many cases  when solving for specific parameters  the application of these analytical expressions may involve a complex iterative procedure       evaluate uniqueness and sensitivity      experience indicates that results of horizontal well test analysis are seldom unique  so it is important that the uniqueness and sensitivity of the results to assumed properties be evaluated  simulation of the test using properties that have been determined from the test can confirm that at least the analysis is consistent with the test data  a simulator can also determine whether other sets of formation properties will also lead to a fit of the data      horizontal well flow regimes     different formation properties can be calculated from the data in each of the five different flow regimes  any flow regime may be absent from a plot of test data because of geometry  wellbore storage  or other factors  nor does the fact that they can appear mean that they do appear  the five different flow regimes that can occur are    early radial  hemi radial  early linear  late pseudoradial  late linear     fig       shows a horizontal well

coordinate system coincide with the direction of principal permeability and the well produces over its entire length    l    w      file vol  page      image      png    fig        well and reservoir geometry and nomenclature for a horizontal well       the axes for this box are the usual   x       y     and   z   axes  notice that the x axis is measured along the bottom edge of the reservoir  going from left to right in the direction perpendicular to the well  the   y   axis lies along the axis from front to back of the reservoir  parallel to the wellbore  the   z   axis is oriented in the direction of reservoir thickness   the total width of the reservoir perpendicular to the wellbore is   a    h    the total length in a direction parallel to the wellbore is   b    h    and the total height of the reservoir is the net pay thickness    h    notice the parameters for the distance from the well to the various borders  along the axis of the well  the shortest distance from the end of the well to a boundary is   d    y    and the longest distance from the other end of the well to the boundary is   d    y    in the vertical direction  the shortest distance to a vertical boundary is   d    z    and the longest distance to a vertical boundary is   d    z         characteristics of flow regimes      consider a well producing at a constant rate  the early radial flow regime occurs

damage caused by overbalanced conditions during completions     the majority of wells previously drilled underbalanced could not be completed underbalanced   the wells were displaced to an overbalanced condition with kill fluid prior to running the liner or completion  depending on the completion fluid type  some formation damage would take place  the damage is not as severe for completion brine as with drilling mud because there are no drilled cuttings and fines in the brine  however  reductions in productivity of    to     have been encountered in underbalanced drilled wells that were killed for the installation of the completion      completion methods for underbalanced drilled  ubd  wells     if the purpose of ubd is reservoir improvement  it is important that the reservoir is never exposed to overbalanced pressure with a nonreservoir fluid  if the well has been drilled underbalanced for drilling problems and productivity improvement is not impaired  then the well can be killed  and a conventional completion approach can be taken   a number of completion methods are available for underbalanced drilled wells    liner and perforation  slotted liner  sandscreens  barefoot  all of these options can be deployed in ubd wells  the use of cemented liners in an underbalanced drilled well is not recommended if the gains in reservoir productivity are to be maintained      installation process     regardless of the liner type run  the installation process for the completion is exactly the same  it is assumed that a packer type completion is installed  the production packer and tailpipe are normally run and set on drillpipe  with an isolation plug installed in the tailpipe  if the well is maintained in an underbalanced condition  well pressure will normally require the production packer and tailpipe to be snubbed into the well against well pressure  the use of pressure operated setting equipment in underbalanced drilled wells is not recommended  a mechanically set production packer should be used       installation of a solid liner      using solid pipe for the liner is no different from snubbing in drillpipe or tubing  the shoe track of the liner must be equipped with nonreturn valves to prevent flow up the inside of the pipe  the liner is normally run with a liner packer  and the liner can be snubbed into the live well  once on bottom  the liner hanger and packer are set and the reservoir is now sealed  if zonal isolation is required  ecps must be run at predetermined intervals  once the liner is set  the pipe must be perforated to obtain flow  this can be achieved using the normal procedures  but it should be remembered that any fluid used must maintain the underbalanced status       installation of a perforated liner or a sandscreen      the main disadvantage of running a slotted liner or sandscreen in an underbalanced drilled well is that isolation is not possible across the slotted section of the liner or screen with the blowout preventors  bops   the use of plugged slots that dissolve once the liner is installed downhole is not deemed safe for offshore operations  the pressure integrity of each slot would need to be tested prior to running each joint  and this is not feasible   the use of special blanking pipe in sandscreen adds further complications to the installation procedures  running a slotted pipe or screen into a live well cannot be done safely  because  even if all the holes are plugged  the potential for a leak is too great  the only way to install a slotted liner in a live well is by using the well as a long lubricator and by isolating the reservoir downhole   there are mechanical methods of downhole isolation that are available  if it is necessary to run a slotted liner  the underbalanced liner bridge plug system is one of the systems currently on the market  this system allows a retrievable plug to be set in the last casing  this isolation plug is released by a retrieving tool that is attached to the bottom of the slotted liner  this retrieving tool unseats the isolation plug and then swallows the isolation plug or packer  the swallowing action of the retrieval tool ensures that the plug and retrieving tool are rigid  and can be run to total depth  td  without hanging up in the open hole  both the packer and retrieval tool are specifically designed to be released by the liner  if necessary  the well can be lubricated to kill fluid on top of the plug  and displaced via the slotted liner when the drillstring is sealed by the rotating diverter  this sentence doesn   t make sense to me  are they killing fluid  i have never heard that phrase used before   the procedure for running a slotted liner and the completion in an underbalanced drilled well is outlined in the

relationships for estimating the amount of oil and gas in a reservoir and for predicting the capacity for flow of oil  water  and gas throughout the life of the reservoir  relative permeabilities and capillary pressure are complex functions of the structure and chemistry of the fluids and solids in a producing reservoir content of this page relies heavily on christiansen  r l        two phase flow through porous media  ch        and    littleton  colorado  knq engineering  as a result  they can vary from place to place in a reservoir  most often  these relationships are obtained by measurements  but network models are emerging as viable routes for estimating capillary pressure and relative permeability functions      permeability     before defining relative permeability and capillary pressure  let us briefly review the definition of permeability  permeability represents the capacity for flow through porous material  it is defined by darcy   s law  without gravitational effects  as  rtenotitle                         darcy   s law relates the flow rate   q   to the permeability   k    cross sectional area   a    viscosity         pressure drop     p    and length   l   of the material  high permeability corresponds to increased capacity for flow  the dimensions of permeability are length squared  often expressed as darcies    darcy                 cm    millidarcies  or micrometers squared  some writers use  quot absolute permeability quot  or  quot intrinsic permeability quot  in place of permeability   for multiple phase flow  the following expressions define relative permeabilities  specifically written for oil and water flow  without gravitational effects  in the   x   direction   rtenotitle                         and  rtenotitle                         where   k    ro   and   k    rw   are the relative permeabilities of oil and water  respectively  relative permeabilities are dimensionless functions that usually range between   and       eqs       and         allow for differences in the pressure in the oil and water phases  the difference in pressure between the two phases is the capillary pressure   rtenotitle                             capillary pressure and permeability relationship      capillary pressure relationships are dimensional functions that range from large negative to large positive values   capillary pressure is often defined as the pressure of the less dense phase minus the pressure of the more dense phase   relative permeabilities and capillary pressures are usually viewed as functions of the saturation of phases in the porous sample   so  for oil water flow in the absence of a gas phase  we have      k    ro     s    w       k    rw     s    w       p    c     s    w     saturation is the fraction of pore

permeability to exceed   when   k    o     s    wi    is the normalizing factor  one must be very careful when using data to note whether absolute permeability or an effective permeability is used for normalizing      trends and cautions in use of rock fluid properties     five important trends and cautions are worth emphasizing    the need for accurate measurement of capillary pressure and relative permeability functions increases with the resolution of reservoir models  with low resolution models  there is a need for algorithms to  quot upscale quot  permeabilities  relative permeabilities  and capillary pressures from the scale of measurement on a small sample of rock to the relatively huge size of blocks in reservoir models  the results of the averaging processes of upscaling are insensitive to the quality of measurements on small samples  the need for upscaling should diminish as increases in computer power permit higher resolution models   to obtain accurate measurements of capillary pressure and relative permeabilities  tests with representative samples at representative conditions are critical  much of the available data in our industry do not pass this standard   capillary end effects and viscous fingering have corrupted a significant portion of relative permeability data  if capillary pressure and relative permeabilities are available  the extent of this corruption for a sample can be assessed and sometimes corrected   we often interpret water oil wettabilities from the shap

to produce centimeter scale images of the borehole wall and the rocks that make it up  the context is  therefore  that of open hole  but some of the tools are closely related to their cased hole equivalents  borehole imaging has been one of the most rapidly advancing technologies in wireline well logging  the applications range from detailed reservoir description through reservoir performance to enhanced hydrocarbon recovery  specific applications are fracture identification  analysis of small scale sedimentological features  evaluation of net pay in thinly bedded formations  and the identification of breakouts  irregularities in the borehole wall that are aligned with the minimum horizontal stress and appear where stresses around the wellbore exceed the compressive strength of the rock    the subject area can be classified into four parts    optical imaging  acoustic imaging  electrical imaging  methods that draw on both acoustic and electrical imaging techniques using the same logging tool  prenskyprensky  s        advances in borehole imaging technology and applications  in borehole imaging  applications and case histories  ed  m  lovell  g  williamson  and p  harvey             london  geological soc  special publications  has provided an excellent review of this important subject      optical imaging     downhole cameras were the first borehole imaging devices  today they furnish a true high resolution color image of the wellbore  the principal drawback is that they require a transparent fluid in liquid filled holes  unless transparent fluid can be injected ahead of the lens  the method fails  this requirement has limited the application of downhole cameras  the other major historic limitation  the need to wait until the camera is recovered before the images can be seen  has fallen away with the introduction of digital systems   the principal application of downhole video has been in air filled holes in which acoustic and contact electrical images cannot be obtained  most applications described in the literature are directed at fracture identification or casing inspection      acoustic imaging     acoustic borehole imaging devices are known as  quot borehole televiewers  quot  they are mandrel tools and provide      coverage of the borehole wall  the first borehole televiewer  operating at a relatively high ultrasonic frequency of      mhz  was developed by mobil corp  in the late     s zemanek  j   caldwell  r l   glenn jr   e e  et al        the borehole televiewer  a new logging concept for fracture location and other types of borehole inspection  j pet technol                  spe      pa   name  quot r  quot  gt zemanek  j   glenn  e e   norton  l j  et al        formation evaluation by inspection with the borehole televiewer  geophysics                     since then  a succession of improvements have been made  principally through advances in digital instrumentation and computer image enhancement  modern tools contain a magnetometer to provide azimuthal information   the borehole televiewer operates with pulsed acoustic energy so that it can image the borehole wall in the presence of opaque drilling muds  short bursts of acoustic energy are emitted by a rotating transducer in pulse echo mode  these travel through the drilling mud and undergo partial reflection at the borehole wall  reflected pulses are received by the transducer  the amplitudes of the reflected pulses form the basis of the acoustic image of the borehole wall  these amplitudes are governed by several factors  the first is the shape of the borehole wall itself  irregularities cause the reflected energy to scatter so that a weaker reflected signal is received by the transducer  examples of these irregularities are fractures  vugs  and breakouts  moreover  the reflected signal is degraded in elliptical and oval wellbores because of non normal incidence  the second factor is the contrast in acoustic impedance between the drilling mud and the material that makes up the borehole wall  acoustic impedance provides an acoustic measure of the relative firmness of the formations penetrated by the wellbore material and  thus  it has the capability of discriminating between different lithologies  with high acoustic impedance giving rise to high reflected amplitudes  borehole televiewers work best where the borehole walls are smooth and the contrast in acoustic impedance is high  the third factor is the scattering or absorption of acoustic energy by particles in the drilling mud  this problem is more serious in heavily weighted muds  which are the most opaque acoustically  and it gives rise to a loss of image resolution   the borehole televiewer can provide a       image in open or cased holes  it can operate in all downhole environments other than gas filled holes  the travel time for the acoustic pulse depends on the dista

supplied as segmental elements for final assembly on site    riveted tanks dating back to the early     s can still be found around the world   many still in service  it is safe to say  however  that recurring maintenance costs and increased environmental and safety concerns dictate that older riveted tanks be replaced with new  state of the art storage tanks    however  bolted tanks are still used  especially in the smaller sizes typical of produced liquid storage  the fourteenth edition of american petroleum institute  api    spec    b  bolted tanks for storage of production liquids   provides standard designs for capacities from     bbl to        bbl  current suppliers of bolted tanks can provide capacities up to        bbl or more depending on the storage application    generally  bolted tanks are fabricated either from     or    gauge steel or several nonmetallic materials  if not galvanized or furnished with a protective coating for corrosion protection  bolted steel construction might not have the expected service life provided by welded steel tanks  welded steel tanks are constructed of thicker plate materials that can be designed to provide some corrosion allowance    one alternative to bolted construction is the shop welded storage tank  the size and capacities of this type of tank are limited primarily by the method of transportation used to transfer the shop built tank to the final production site  the eleventh edition of api   spec    f  shop welded tanks for storage of production liquids   provides standard designs for capacities of    to     bbl     table      presents a partial listing of the standard sizes specified in api   spec    f    in this table   quot working capacity quot  refers to the maximum amount of oil that can be stored between the oil outlet and the overflow connection    file vol  page     image      png    table        shop welded storage tanks provide the production industry with tanks of adequate safety and reasonable economy for use in the storage of crude petroleum and other liquids commonly handled by the production segment of the industry  a shop fabricated tank is tested for leaks in the shop  so it is ready for use once it arrives on site  tanks are transferred from the truck to the final location on site  completed piping connections and the tank is then ready to be brought on line    a second alternative for bolted construction is the shop fabricated or field assembled nonmetallic storage tank  nonmetallic tanks customarily are constructed from plastic materials  these have the advantage of being noncorroding  durable  low cost  and lightweight  probably the most common type used is the fiberglass reinforced plastic  frp

flowing pressure traverses  the traverse below the point of gas injection includes only formation gas  whereas  the traverse above the point of gas injection includes both the formation and injection gases  these two distinct flowing pressure traverses and their corresponding gas liquid ratios  glr  are illustrated in    fig          file vol  page     image      png    fig    flowing pressure gradient traverses above and below the depth of gas injection in a continuous flow gas lift well          design methods     there are numerous gas lift installation design methods offered in the literature  several installation designs require unique valve construction or gas lift valve injection gas throughput performance  only two design techniques are illustrated in this page    a design based on a constant decrease in the operating injection gas pressure for each succeeding lower valve  this design is essentially the same as the api gas lift design technique in   rp   v   api rp   v   recommended practice for design of continuous flow gas lift installations using injection pressure operated valves  second edition        washington  dc  api    an alternative design for wells requiring high injection gas rates   the api design can be used on the majority of wells in the us  however  when high volume lift and high injection gas rates are required  gas lift valve performance should be considered in the design  both of these techniques use the simple single element type  unbalanced  gas lift valve with a nitrogen charged bellows  this type of valve is the most widely used in the industry and is available from all major gas lift equipment manufacturers   gas lift installation design calculations are divided into two parts    determination of the gas lift valve depths  calculation of the test rack opening pressures of the gas lift valves  the opening pressures are calculated after the valve depths because the operating injection gas and flowing production pressures and temperatures during unloading are based on these valve depths   the primary objective of this page is to outline in detail installation design methods for calculating the valve depths and the test rack opening pressures of the gas lift valves that will unload a well to a maximum depth of lift for the available injection gas volume and pressure  the unloading operations  as illustrated by the two pen pressure recorder chart in    fig        should be automatic  the static load fluid level was near the surface in the casing and tubing before initial unloading began  the wellhead pressure remains relatively constant during u tubing operations before injection gas enters the tubing for the first time through the top gas lift valve  a surge in wellhead tubing pressure and a decrease in the injection gas casing pressure occur as the depth of gas injection transfers to each lower gas lift valve  as each lower gas lift valve is uncovered  the valve immediately above closes  and the point of gas injection transfers from the upper to the lower valve  all gas lift valves above an operating valve should be closed and the valves below should be open in a properly designed gas lift installation    file vol  page     image      png    fig    two pen pressure recorder chart illustrating continuous flow gas lift unloading operations with choke control of the injection gas          description of unloading operations     the depths of the unloading gas lift valves are calculated to unload the kill  load  fluid to the design depth of the operating valve with the injection gas pressure and gas volume available at the wellsite  as the injection gas is initially injected into the casing annulus  the injection gas pressure downstream of the control device on the injection gas line increases as the load fluid level in the casing annulus is lowered during u tubing of the load fluid  the load fluid is transferred into the tubing through the open gas lift valves in a well with a packer  or through the open gas lift valves and lower end of the tubing in a well without a packer  initial gas lift operations begin after the first gas lift valve is uncovered and injection gas enters the tubing at this top valve depth   the pressures in the casing and tubing are essentially equal at the instant a gas lift valve is uncovered  immediately after injection gas begins to enter the tubing through the next lower gas lift valve  the injection gas pressure in the casing begins to decrease because the newly uncovered gas lift valve is set to remain open at a lower injection gas pressure than the unloading valve above  less and less injection gas enters the tubing through the upper unloading valve  the injection gas rate through the newly uncovered valve increases until the injection gas pressure in the casing decreases to the closing pressure of the upper unloading valve  the de

the domain of the engineering community  petroleum engineers are responsible for drilling costs and are often involved with other engineers in estimating costs for pipelines  facilities  and other elements of the infrastructure for the development of an oil gas field   all practicing engineers have heard horror stories of cost and schedule overruns  and some have even been involved directly with projects that had large overruns  why did these overruns occur  and what could have been done to encompass the actual cost in the project estimate  overruns can result from    inefficiencies   unscheduled problems and delays   changes in design or execution  or  a host of other reasons  the upstream oil gas industry is a risky business  one inherently risky operation that we routinely undertake is drilling and completing a well  thus  it should come as no surprise that estimating the total cost and time of a drilling prospect is a common application of uncertainty analysis  principally monte carlo simulation   cost models fall into the general class of aggregation models   we add line item costs to get a total cost  these line items are specified as ranges or probability distributions  and the total cost is then a sum of the line items       simple authorization for expenditure  afe  model         table      shows a probabilistic afe for drilling a single well  the line items are described by symmetric triangular distributions  there are two subsections of the model  each with a cost subtotal    the first cost subtotal comprises the cost of goods and services  consumables and tangibles  that are not time dependent   the second cost subtotal represents the rig cost  i e   the costs attributable to accomplishing each phase     file vol  page     image      png    table     generic afe model      the two ultimate outputs are cost total  the sum of the two subtotals  and rig time   the user enters estimates for the minimum  most likely  and maximum for each estimated line item  in the top portion  the user enters estimates for line item costs  in the bottom portion  the user enters estimates for the activity times  the costs associated with these tasks are then calculated as the time to complete the task multiplied by the rig day rate   assumptions include    items in the activity portion include all aspects of drilling  thus  the          in  section    would include any tripping  minor expected delays  running casing  and cementing  in addition to drilling   see comments on level of detail    there is no correlation between any pair of items   the rig day rate is either a constant  if the rig is under contract  or a distribution  no contract    the estimate covers only    scheduled events    and does not take into account either change of scope or    trouble time      some of these assumptions make the model simpler to design but less realistic  these shortcomings are easy to overcome  as we address later in this section       why use triangular inputs       in our example of a simple afe model  we chose symmetric triangular distributions for the inputs  why  our example came from a location where there were many offset and analogous wells on which to base our cost and time distributions  many cost engineers are trained to provide a base cost  which is frequently viewed as a most likely value together with a downside and upside  sometimes stated as a plus and minus percentage of the base cost   the triangular distribution is therefore a natural starting point  in practice  many line item ranges are right skewed  acknowledging the belief that time and cost have more potential to exceed the base case than to fall short   another skewed right distribution is the log normal  and it is also popular for line items  one drawback of the log normal for cost estimates  however  is that it is fully determined by specifying only two points  not three  although some users take three points and convert to a log normal  one should be careful with the process  suppose  for instance  that we are given the three values         and     for a low  most likely  and high estimate for some line item  we could use the two extreme values as a p    and p     and assume that this     range  confidence interval  between them is approximately four standard deviations  the logic is that for normal distributions  the range would be exactly      standard deviations  for log normal distributions  there is no simple rule  though experimentation would lead to a reasonable estimate  once the standard deviation is estimated  one other value determines a unique log normal  and the user may typically decide that the mid range value will serve for a mode  p    or mean       resulting time and cost estimates         figs

fluid estimates  presented at the spwla   th annual logging symposium  oslo  norway     may   june  paper ii  nmr measurements are not instantaneous  they involve both polarization and decay  time

incomplete polarization or incomplete measurement of the decay  low velocity motion affects only the decay  but high speed motion can also affect the initial decay amplitude   the currently available lwd tools offer different solutions to this concern  while both tool designs can operate in either   t    or   t    acquisition mode and both incorporate accelerometers and magnetometers for detecting lateral motion for quality control of the nmr measurements  they differ in their choice of primary measurement mode  operational factors  such as the slower logging speed  i e   rate of penetration in

with some intermediate weight hydrocarbon molecules  the dry gas phase diagram in fig   indicates that because of this composition  dry gases do not undergo phase changes following a pressure reduction and therefore no liquids are formed either in the reservoir or production facilities because the path of depletion is completely outside the phase envelope  a volumetric dry gas reservoir is completely enclosed by low permeability or completely impermeable barriers and does not receive pressure support from external sources  such as an encroaching aquifer  in addition  if the expansion of rock and connate water are negligible  then the primary source of pressure maintenance is gas expansion resulting from gas production and the subsequent pressure reduction       dry gas reservoirs with water influx    dry gas reservoirs with water influx from an aquifer are non volumetric reservoirs and they produce under the pressure support provided by the encroaching water  of course this encroaching water tends to maintain the pressure at higher values depending on the rate at which water encroaches into the reservoir  however  the recovery factors for this type of reservoirs can be significantly lower than that for volumetric reservoirs produced by the simple gas expansion  the reason is that gas is often bypassed and trapped by the encroaching water    file vol  page      image

productive life of the reservoir  simple gas expansion is a very efficient drive mechanism  even though gas saturations at abandonment can be quite high  ultimate recoveries of     to     of the original gas in place are routinely achieved in volumetric gas reservoirs  the percentage of the original volume of gas in place that can be recovered depends on the abandonment pressure only  which is usually determined  by economical rather than technical considerations   we can also estimate the gas reserve or the total cumulative gas production gp  for gas reservoirs under water drive  add caption here  partial water drive reservoirs are characterized by pressure declines greater than a complete water drive but less than a volumetric reservoirs   which is the case of the next

and permeability at the reservoir level  the development of a complete petrophysical database is the critical first step  this section describes the requirements for creating such a database before making any of these calculations  the topic is divided into four parts  inventory of existing petrophysical data  evaluation of the quality of existing data  conditioning the data for reservoir parameter calculations  and acquisition of additional petrophysical data  where needed  the overall goal of developing the petrophysical database is to use as much valid data as possible to develop the best standard from which to make the calculations of the petrophysical parameters      inventory of existing petrophysical data     to start the petrophysical calculations  the data that have been gathered previously from various wellbores throughout the reservoir must be identified  organized  and put into electronic form for future calculations   in a typical reservoir  several  quot generations quot  of wells have been drilled  the exploration wells that discover and delineate the reservoir constitute the first generation of wells  these wells are usually drilled with scant knowledge of formation pressure  which results in deep mud filtrate invasion in the reservoir interval for which there may be significant hole washout problems  for this series of wells  the muds used may vary from one well to the next  and this phase may take from   to    years to complete  the second generation is the group of wells drilled during initial reservoir development  these wells are likely to be drilled with a common mud system  which might be either water based or oil based and will be tailored to help minimize the near wellbore damage caused by detrimental mud filtrate reservoir rock interactions  third generation wells may also be available  these wells would be those from later field development activities and may have been drilled   to    years after the initial development wells were drilled   the logs from these various generations of wells can vary in several regards  first  the logs may have been run by various service companies and may not be directly comparable to each other  even if they were from the same time period  secondly  if the logs were run by the same service company  they may still have significant differences because different generations of logging tools were used for each set of wells  an additional difference may be between logging while drilling  lwd  logs and those run on wireline  lwd logging is often associated with high angle wells  this geometry can lead to significantly different responses from zones previously seen in vertical wells and may lead to petrophysical mapping issues for high angle well evaluations  if not correctly accounted for   many of these same caveats hold for core data  the early wells may or may not have been completely cored through the reservoir interval  later wells are more likely to be fully cored  although some zones of particular interest may have a greater concentration of cores  the routine data acquisition from cores also may vary because of different laboratories performing

routinely think of performing an openhole completion when confronted with selecting a completion  this is true probably because cased hole completions are so widely accepted and because they are not familiar with selection criteria and procedures  openhole completions can provide excellent  high productivity completions  but they must be applied under the right reservoir conditions  they avoid the difficulties and concerns of perforation packing and reduce the gravel placement operations to the relatively simple task of packing the screen openhole annulus  because openhole gravel packs have no perforation tunnels  formation fluids can converge toward and through the gravel pack radically from        eliminating the high pressure drop associated with linear flow through perforation tunnels  the reduced pressure drop through an openhole gravel pack virtually guarantees that it will be more productive than a cased hole gravel pack in the same formation  provided they are executed properly      theoretical pressure drops        fig   penberthy  w l  jr  and shaughnessy  c m        sand control            richardson  texas  monograph series  spe     illustrates the theoretical pressure drops experienced in openhole and cased hole gravel packs  it reveals that openhole gravel packs result in virtually no additional pressure drop as the formation fluids converge at the wellbore    file vol  page     image      png    fig      comparison of pressure drawdowns for cased  and openhole gravel packs          guidelines for selecting openhole gravel pack candidates     despite their potential for creating high productivity wells  openhole gravel packs are not suitable for all reservoirs and formations  one disadvantage of the openhole completion  including openhole gravel packs  is the inability to always isolate unwanted water and or gas production  unlike cased hole completions that can be precisely and selectively perforated in the zones of interest  openhole completions sometimes offer less control over fluids  water  oil  and gas  exposed to the wellbore  in a cased hole  remedial operations such as squeeze cementing  plugbacks  or straddle packoffs to isolate unwanted fluid production are can be carried out with a reasonably good chance of success with little to no planning  such remedial operations in an openhole well  with the exception of a plugback  require additional planning to isolate undesirable fluids  with this in mind  openhole completions are best suited for thick reservoir sands rather than multiple sand reservoirs where there is water and or gas to contend with   maintaining borehole stability during drilling and completion is an essential requirement for openhole gravel packs  concern over the lack of borehole stability is a primary reason that openhole gravel packs are not used more often in unconsolidated  dilatant formations  unstable boreholes make running of the gravel pack assembly difficult and may prevent proper gravel placement if the formation flows in around the screen  fortunately  state of the art drill in fluids are usually effective in maintaining borehole stability while performing a horizontal completion in dilatant type formations   openhole gravel packs should be avoided in formations with several sand and shale laminations if the shales are prone to uncontrollable eroding and or sloughing  during gravel placement  the shale can intermix with the gravel pack sand  resulting in reduced gravel permeability and impaired well performance  again  proper drill in fluid selection can alleviate some of the problems associated with laminated sand and shale formations   openhole gravel pack candidates include    formations where cased hole gravel packing has unacceptable productivity   wells where increased productivity is required   reservoirs where long  sustained single phase hydrocarbon flow is anticipated   situations where workovers for isolating gas or water cannot be accomplished   wells where high water oil or gas oil ratios can be tolerated   reservoirs with single uniform sands  avoid multiple sands interspersed with troublesome shale layers or water sands    formations that can be drilled and completed maintaining borehole stability in the completion interval   wells where cased hole completions are significantly more expensive  i e   long horizontal wells       top set openhole gravel pack     the most common type of openhole completion is referred to as    top set     which is illustrated in    fig        while this figure shows a vertical completion  this discussion is also pertinent to openhole horizontal wells  in this completion  the production casing is set at the top of the completion interval to isolate overlying strata  once the casing is cemented  the following steps are undertaken    productive formation is drilled to total depth  hole is cleaned and displ

especially reservoir modeling and simulation  the discussion below focuses on a range of statistical concepts that engineers may find valuable to understand  the focus here is classical statistics  but differences in the application for geostatistics are included      measurement systems     a quantitative approach requires more than a headlong rush into the data  armed with a computer  because conclusions from a quantitative study are based at least in part on inferences drawn from measurements  the geoscientist and reservoir engineer must be aware of the nature of the measurement systems with which the data are collected   there are four measurement scales    nominal  ordinal  interval  ratio  each of these scales is more rigorously defined than the one before it  the nominal and ordinal scales classify observations into exclusive categories  the interval and ratio scales involve determinations of the magnitude of an observation and so are the ones we normally think of as    measurements    davis  j c        statistics and data analysis in geology  second edition  new york city  john wiley  amp  sons  all four of these systems are used in reservoir descriptions       nominal scale      the nominal scale classifies observations into mutually exclusive categories of equal rank  such as    red        green     or    blue     symbols  e g   a  b  c  or numbers  often are used  as well  in geostatistics  for example  when predicting lithofacies occurrence  we often code lithofacies as       and   for sand  siltstone  and shale  respectively  within this code  or scale  there is no connotation that   is    twice as much    as    or that   is    greater than       furthermore  a lithofacies value such as     has no meaning at all       ordinal scale      in an ordinal scale  observations are ranked hierarchically  a classic example of an ordinal scale in the geosciences is the mohs hardness scale  although the ranking scale extends from one to ten  the step from   to   is not equal in magnitude to that from   to     thus  the mohs hardness scale is a nonlinear scale of mineral hardness  in the petroleum industry  too  kerogen types are based on an ordinal scale that reflects the stages of organic diagenesis       interval scale      the interval scale is so named because the width of successive intervals remains constant  a common example of an interval scale is temperature  the increase in temperature between    and     c is the same as the increase between     and      c  an interval scale does not have a natural zero or a point where the magnitude is nonexistent  and so it is possible to have negative values  however  in the petroleum industry  some reservoir properties are based on an interval scale measured along continuums for which there are practical limits  it would be impossible  for example  to have negative porosity  permeability  or thickness  or porosity greater than            ratio scale      ratios not only have equal increments between steps  but also have a zero point  ratio scales are the highest form of measurement  all types of mathematical and statistical operations are performed with them  many geologic measurements are done on a ratio scale because they have units of length  volume  mass  and so forth  a commonly used ratio in the petroleum industry is the net to gross ratio of pay and nonpay   for most of discussion in this page  focus will be centered mainly on the analysis of interval and ratio data  typically  no distinction is made between the two  and they may occur intermixed in the same problem  for example  a net to gross map is a ratio  whereas porosity and permeability measurements are on an interval scale      samples and sample populations     statistical analysis is built around the concepts of    populations    and    samples    and implicitly assumes that the sampling is random and unbiased    a population is a well defined set of elements  either finite or infinite   which commonly are measurements and observations made on items of a specific type  e g   porosity or permeability    a sample is a subset of elements taken from the population   furthermore  there are finite and infinite  or parent  populations  a finite population might consist of all the wells drilled in the gulf of mexico during the year       for example  whereas the parent population would be all possible wells drilled in the gulf of mexico in the past  present  and future  albeit a practical impossibility    each reservoir is unique and completely deterministic  thus  if all the information were available  there would be no uncertainty about the reservoir  unfortunately  though  our sample data set offers us a sparse and incomplete picture of the reservoir  furthermore  the sampling program  drilling wells  is highly biased  at least spatially  in that we generally do not drill wells

second law quot  of thermodynamics  entropy is a thermodynamic property that expresses the unidirectional nature of a process and  in some sense  is  quot nature   s clock  quot  for example  a cup of hot coffee at room temperature cools down instead of heating up      unidirectional nature of processes   conservation of total mass and energy are insufficient to solve many phase equilibrium problems  processes that satisfy these conservation equations may not be physically possible  that is  the process of a cold cup of coffee spontaneously heating up on your dinner table would satisfy the first law of thermodynamics but has a near zero probability to occur  processes have a natural direction to them in that spontaneous processes tend to dissipate gradients in the system until equilibrium is reached  e g    darcy   s law for pressure gradients  fick   s law for concentration gradients  a system that is not subject to forced flows of mass or energy from its surroundings will evolve to a time invariant state that is uniform or composed of uniform subsystems   the equilibrium state  the second law of thermodynamics introduces a new thermodynamic property  entropy  and provides a mathematical statement that describes this unidirectional nature of processes    the second law also has implications for the efficiency of processes  heat and work are not of the same quality in that work can be efficiently converted to thermal energy  e g   frictional heat losses   but thermal energy can be only partially converted into mechanical energy  e g   steam power plants   thus  work is a more valuable form of energy than heat   work has a high quality  furthermore  energy at higher temperatures is more useful than energy at lower temperatures  for example  the ocean contains an immense amount of energy  but it is not very useful because of its low temperature  energy is degraded when heat transfers from one system to another of lower temperature  entropy is a measure of the energy degradation or disorder of the system      entropy   entropy is a thermodynamic property just like temperature and pressure  entropy is a state function  in which changes during a reversible process in a closed system are given by the ratio   q     t    entropy increases as   t   decreases or   q   increases    entropy is related to the likelihood that equilibrium will be reached  entropy is best understood by examining a very simple example at the microscopic scale     fig       shows the initial state of a hypothetical closed system that contains four molecules  the system is initially partitioned into two halves  such that the molecules from one half cannot move into the other half  one molecule is in the left subsystem and three are in another  thus  the pressures are not initially the same  each subsystem has only one possible configuration   the initial state  thus  the subsystems are well ordered  and entropy is initially small     file vol  page     image      png    fig        illustration of entropy for a closed composite system with four molecules   after smith   et al      the molecules on each side of the partition are initially constrained by a partition  after the partition is removed  the molecules are free to move around the entire system by brownian motion  equilibrium is the most likely final state       when the partition is removed  however  the molecules from each subsystem are free to move into the other half of the system  and a total of    different configurations are possible  as shown in    fig        because each of these configurations is equally likely  the probability that the system will be found in its original configuration is only       i e           the system is more likely to contain two molecules in each subsystem  probability of      or       which is the equilibrium state   the most disordered state  entropy is related to the maximum number of possible configurations of the system  and thus  the entropy after the partition is removed has increased  the configurations could also be arrangements of energy quanta  instead of molecular arrangements  as in this example    although the original configuration for four molecules is not improbable  real systems contain many more molecules  for example  if one mole of a gas were present in the system              molecules   the likelihood that the system would be found in its initial state would be very unlikely                  however  the probability that the system would contain a similar number of molecules on each side would be near      i e   the pressure would be equal throughout the closed system       open system   the steps to write the entropy balance for an open system are similar to those for the first law of thermodynamics  we allow for the following     mass flows into or out of the system at only one location on the boundary of the sy

 instruments for conducting directional surveys can be set up in several different variations  depending on the intended use of the instrument and the methods used to store or transmit survey information      types of survey instruments     basically  there are two types of survey instruments    magnetic  gyroscopic  depending on the method used to store the data  there are film and electronic systems  survey systems can also be categorized by the methods used to transmit the data to the surface  such as wireline or measurement while drilling  mwd        magnetic sensors      magnetic sensors must be run within a nonmagnetic environment  i e   in uncased hole either in a nonmagnetic drill collar s  or on a wireline   in any case  there must not be any magnetic interference from adjacent wells  magnetic sensors can be classified into two categories    mechanical compass  electronic compass       mechanical compass       a mechanical compass uses a compass card that orients itself to magnetic north  similar to a hiking compass needle  inclination is measured by means of a pendulum or a float device  in the pendulum device  the pendulum is either suspended over a fixed grid or along a vernier scale and is allowed to move as the inclination changes  the float device suspends a float in fluid that allows the instrument tube to move around it independently as the inclination changes   the only advantage of mechanical compasses is the low cost  while several disadvantages have limited them from being used widely in directional surveys  the drawbacks are    high maintenance costs  a need to choose inclination range  limited temperature capability  the possibility of human error in reading film  the inability to use them in mwd tools       electronic compass       the electronic compass system is a solid state  self contained  directional surveying instrument that measures the earth   s magnetic and gravitational forces  inclination is measured by gravity accelerometers  which measure the earth   s gravitational field in the x  y  and z planes  the z plane is along the tool axis  x is perpendicular to z and in line with the tool   s reference slot  and y is perpendicular to both x and z  from this measurement  the vector components can be summed to determine inclination  hole direction is measured by gravity accelerometers and fluxgate magnetometers  fluxgate magnetometers measure components of the earth   s magnetic field orthogonally  i e   in the same three axes as the accelerometers   from this measurement  the vector components can be summed to determine hole direction   depending on the packaging of the electronic sensors  the electronic compass system can be employed in different modes  such as single shot  multishots  and mwd  in which data are sent to surface in real time through the mud pulse telemetry system   the electronic magnetic single shot records a single survey record while drilling the well  the sensors measure the earth   s magnetic and gravitational forces with fluxgate magnetometers and gravity accelerometers  respectively  the components of this survey system include the probe and a battery stack that supplies power to the probe  the raw data are stored downhole in the memory and retrieved at the surface to calculate the hole direction  inclination  and tool face  the electronic magnetic multishot uses the same components as the electronic single shot  the only difference is that electronic multishots record multiple survey records  the mwd acquires downhole information during drilling operations that can be used to make timely decisions about the drilling process  the magnetic survey information is obtained with an electronic compass  but  unlike previous systems that stored the information  the mwd encodes the survey data in mud pulses that are sent up and decoded at the surface  the real time survey information enables the drillers to make directional drilling decisions while drilling  the sensors used in mwd tools are the same design as those used in electronic magnetic single shot and multishots  i e   gravity accelerometers and fluxgate magnetometers         the geomagnetic field       both types of magnetic sensors rely upon detecting the earth   s magnetic field to determine hole direction  the earth can be imagined as having a large bar magnet at its center  laying  almost  along the north south spin axis  see    fig         the normal lines of the magnetic field will emanate from the bar magnet in a pattern such that at the magnetic north and south poles  the lines of force  flux lines  will lay vertically  or at      to the earth   s surface  while at the magnetic equator  the lines of force will be horizontal  or at     to the earth   s surface  at any point on the earth  a magnetic field can be observed having a strength and a direction  vector   the strength i

 cementing operations can be divided into two broad categories  primary cementing and remedial cementing      primary cementing     the objective of primary cementing is to provide zonal isolation  cementing is the process of mixing a slurry of cement  cement additives and water and pumping it down through casing to critical points in the annulus around the casing or in the open hole below the casing string  the two principal functions of the cementing process are    to restrict fluid movement between the formations  to bond and support the casing  if this is achieved effectively  other requirements imposed during the life of the well will be met  including    economic  liability  safety  government regulations      zonal isolation      zonal isolation is not directly related to production  however  this necessary task must be performed effectively to allow production or stimulation operations to be conducted  the success of a well depends on this primary operation  in addition to isolating oil   gas   and water producing zones  cement also aids in   protecting the casing from corrosion  preventing blowouts by quickly forming a seal  protecting the casing from shock loads in deeper drilling  sealing off zones of lost circulation or thief zones     remedial cementing     remedial cementing is usually done to correct problems associated with the primary cement job  the most successful and economical approach to remedial cementing is to avoid it by thoroughly planning  designing  and executing all drilling  primary cementing  and completion operations  the need for remedial cementing to restore a well   s operation indicates that primary operational planning and execution were ineffective  resulting in costly repair operations  remedial cementing operations consist of two broad categories    squeeze cementing  plug cementing     cement placement procedures     in general  there are five steps required to obtain successful cement placement and meet the objectives previously outlined    analyze the well parameters  define the needs of the well  and then design placement techniques and fluids to meet the needs for the life of the well  fluid properties  fluid mechanics  and chemistry influence the design used for a well   calculate fluid  slurry  composition and perform laboratory tests on the fluids designed in    step      to see that they meet the needs   use necessary hardware to implement the design in    step       calculate volume of fluids  slurry  to be pumped  and blend  mix  and pump fluids into the annulus   monitor the treatment in real time  compare with    step      and make changes as necessary   evaluate the results  compare with the design in    step      and make changes as necessary for future jobs      well parameters     along with supporting the casing in the wellbore  the cement is designed to isolate zones  meaning that it keeps each of the penetrated zones and their fluids from communicating with other zones  to keep the zones isolated  it is critical to consider the wellbore and its properties when designing a cement job       depth      the depth of the well affects the cement slurry design because it influences the following factors   amount of wellbore fluids involved volume of wellbore fluids friction pressures hydrostatic pressures temperature  wellbore depth also controls hole size and casing size  extremely deep wells have their own distinct design challenges because of    high temperatures  high pressures  corrosive fluids      wellbore geometry      the geometry of the wellbore is important in determining the amount of cement required for the cementing operation  hole dimensions can be measured using a variety of methods  including    acoustic calipers  electric log calipers  fluid calipers  openhole geometry can indicate adverse  undesirable  conditions such as washouts  wellbore geometry and casing dimensions determine the annular volume and the amount of fluid necessary   the hole shape also determines the clearance between the casing and the wellbore  this annular space influences the effectiveness of drilling fluid displacement  a minimum annular space of      to     in   hole diameter   to   in  greater than casing diameter  is recommended  annular clearances that are smaller restrict the flow characteristics and generally make it more difficult to displace fluids   another aspect of hole geometry is the deviation angle  the deviation angle influences the true vertical depth and temperatures  highly deviated wellbores can be challenging because the casing is not as likely to be centered in the wellbore  and fluid displacement becomes difficult   problems created by geometry variations can be overcome by adding centralizers to the casing  centralizers help to center the casing within the hole  leaving equal annular space around the casing       temperatu

instruments     the survey instrument   s performance depends on the package design elements  calibration performance  and quality control during operation  system performance will functionally depend on the borehole inclination  azimuth  geomagnetic field vector  and geographical position  because of the dependency on sensing earth   s spin rate  the performance of gyro compassing tools is inversely proportional to the cosine of the latitude of wellbore location  the sensor systems    performance generally degrades as the inclination increases  especially in an east west direction at higher latitudes  for magnetic tools  high latitudes result in weaker horizontal components of earth   s field  for two axis gyro tools  the approach to east west at high inclinations places the sensor axes increasingly parallel to earth   s spin  with magnetic tools  errors increase at high east west inclinations because of the progressive difficulty in compensating for the effect of drillstring magnetism       gyro complications      gyros suffer from the additional problem of time related drift uncertainty  the time component may be significant for gyro systems  particularly in horizontal wells and possibly in east west orientation  the survey duration inevitably extends beyond the average survey duration period  long survey duration means larger drift uncertainty and more exposure to the wellbore environment  which may potentially reduce the accuracy of directional data   the ability of the tool to freefall into the well will decrease substantially at approximately       consequently  gyro performance degrades at       and most gyros cannot be used to survey at greater than           tool misalignment     the misalignment of the survey instrument with the wellbore results in errors in measuring wellbore axis direction and inclination   note  inclination and azimuth are affected   sources of this kind of error are detailed in    table       sensor to instrument error is independent of inclination  which is an important variable for both instrument to drillstring casing and drillstring to wellbore  misalignments have long been recognized as significant error sources in directional surveying    file devol      final page     image      png    table     sources of tool mislignment errors         measured depth  md  error     sources of depth error depend on the type of survey system used  drillpipe conveyed tools  measurement while drilling  mwd   multishots  and single shot  suffer from errors in the physical measurement of drillpipes and the differential effects of drillstring compression and stretch  because of wellbore friction  drillstring compression and stretch are not easily calculated  particularly in inclined wells  depth errors can account for the relatively large angular errors frequently observed when comparing overlapping  high accuracy surveys in deviated wells   wireline survey tools generally have smaller depth errors than drillstring conveyed tools  provided adequate quality control measures have been taken  errors on the order of         for gyroscopic tools and         for drillstring tools are commonly quoted  however  this may not apply to horizontal well situations      magnetic interference     magnetic interference may be defined as corruption of the geomagnetic field by a field from an external source  this can cause serious errors in measuring hole direction  azimuth   potential sources of magnetic interference are    drillstrings  adjacent wells  casing shoes  magnetic formations     hot spots    in nonmagnetic drill collars  although all the previous error sources may compromise the magnetic survey   s quality  drillstring  axial  interference is probably the most common and frequent cause of errors in hole direction  the drillstrings may be regarded as a steel bar  dipole magnet  the normal approach for magnetic survey tools is to place the survey sensor within sufficient quantity of nonmagnetic drill collars in the bottomhole assembly  bha   azimuth measurement errors are minimized by virtue of their distance from the interference source  magnetic interference diminishes proportionally with the inverse of the square of the distance from the source  the bar dipole magnet analogy is simplistic  there is evidence that downhole drillstring magnetism may be much more complex  even dynamic in nature  in practice  it may be hard to remove interference completely  the magnitude of the effect of magnetic interference depends on the strength of the interference field as well as the inclination and direction of the wellbore and its geographical latitude  highly deviated wells drilled in an east west direction are likely to suffer greater magnetic interference

   s    wc    is the objective  either saturation is measured where one phase effectively is stationary in the pore space  i e   is at residual saturation  and the other phase can flow to the wellbore  recently  the swct method has been extended to measure oil water fractional flow at measured fluid saturations in situations in which both oil and water phases are mobile the swct test is used primarily to quantify the target oil saturation before initiating improved oil recovery  ior  operations  to measure the effectiveness of ior agents in a single well pilot and to assess a field for bypassed oil targets  secondarily  it is used to measure   s    wc   accurately for better evaluation of original oil in place  ooip   fractional flow measurement provides realistic input for

oil producing regions of the world is organic deposits forming both in and around the wellbore  these organic deposits fall into two broad categories    paraffins  asphaltenes  these deposits can occur in tubing  or in the pores of the reservoir rock  both effectively choke the flow of hydrocarbons  this article discusses the source  deposition  removal  and prevention of these deposits      paraffin and asphaltenes in crude oil     crude oils contain three main groups of compounds    saturated hydrocarbons or paraffins  aromatic hydrocarbons  resins and asphaltenes     table      shows the gross composition of crude oils  tars  and bitumens obtained from various sources  it is evident that crude oils contain substantial proportions of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons with relatively small percentages of resins and asphaltenes  more degraded crudes  including tars and bitumens  contain substantially larger proportions of resins and asphaltenes    file vol  page     image      png    table           paraffin deposition     paraffins are high molecular weight alkanes  c     that can build up as deposits in the wellbore  in feed lines  etc  these organic deposits can act as chokes within the wellbore  resulting in a gradual decrease in production with time as the deposits increase in thickness  this can result in producing problems unless some remedial action is taken on a systematic and periodic basis  deposits vary in consistency from soft accumulations to hard  brittle deposits  usually the deposits are firmer and harder as the molecular weight of the paraffin deposits increases  sometimes paraffins and asphaltenes occur together in organic deposits   the primary cause of wax or paraffin deposition is simply a loss in solubility in the crude oil

result of changes in temperature  pressure  or composition of the crude oil as a result of loss of dissolved gases  paraffins that have the highest melting point and molecular weight are usually the first to separate from solution  with lower molecular weight paraffins separating as the temperature decreases further  for example  a c   alkane with a melting point of about      f will deposit at a much higher temperature than a c   alkane with a melting point of     f   the ability of the crude oil to hold the paraffin in solution is generally quantified with two indicators    pour point  cloud point  the procedure for measuring the pour point and cloud point may be found in astm manuals  d        for cloud points and d      for pour points   the cloud point is defined as the temperature at which paraffins begin to come out of solution and a clear solution of hydrocarbons turns cloudy  obviously  it is difficult to measure the cloud point for dark crude oil  because cloudiness is not visible  in such cases  the presence of paraffin crystals may have to be detected with a polarizing light microscope  the pour point is defined as the temperature at which the crude oil no longer flows from its container  as the temperature is lowered  wax crystals form an interlocking network that supports the hydrocarbon liquid within it  this network of paraffin crystals is quite shear sensitive and loose when first formed but can harden and become extremely rigid as fluid is lost from it  pour points are relatively easy to measure in the field and provide a good indication of conditions under which large quantities of paraffin will fall out of solution in crude oils   the most common cause of loss of solubility of the paraffin in the crude oil is a decrease in temperature

fractures and not from the matrix porous sandstone  to carry out the most efficient waterflooding strategy  the knowledge of fracture direction was imperative  instead of a costly water injection pilot project  natural gas with tracer was injected into a central well for    weeks to define the fracture pattern  the   kr tracer applied was injected continuously with a concentration    times

radioactivity increases were detected at any of the other    wells monitored  either continuously or intermittently  during the tracer survey  the cyclic nature of tracer appearance was attributed to the necessity for overcoming the varying hydrostatic head of oil in the well and to the appreciable difference in effective permeability of the principal and cross fracture systems  apparently

facilities for more details      tubing  and wireline retrievable equipment     the early gas lift valves were the conventional tubing retrievable type  in which the tubing mandrel that held the gas lift valve and reverse check valve was part of the tubing string  it was necessary to pull the tubing to replace a conventional gas lift valve  the first selectively wireline retrievable gas lift valve and mandrel were introduced around       the wireline retrievable valve mandrel was designed with a pocket receiver within the mandrel  a gas lift valve could be removed or installed by wireline operations without pulling the tubing  the primary wireline device for locating the mandrel pocket and selectively removing or installing a gas lift valve is a kickover tool  the mandrel is called a sidepocket mandrel because the pocket is offset from the centerline of the tubing  most sidepocket type retrievable valve mandrels have a full bore inside diameter  id  equal to the tubing id  these mandrels permit normal wireline operations  such as pressure surveys  this wireline retrievable system for gas lift valves revolutionized the application of gas lift for inaccessible wells  the newer generation of retrievable valve mandrels uses orienting devices to ensure successful wireline operation in highly deviated wells  a description of such equipment can be found in api   spec    v     api spec    v   specification for gas lift equipment  first edition        washington  dc  api   the operating principles for a given type of tubing retrievable or wireline retrievable gas lift valve are the same  although the performance characteristics may vary between the same type of tubing  and wireline retrievable valve  the installation design calculations outlined in this chapter do not change  the choice between tubing  and wireline retrievable equipment depends primarily on the costs associated with pulling the tubing and whether a workover fluid may damage the deliverability of a well   with the increased cost of pulling the tubing in today   s field operations  wireline retrievable equipment is now used in most new wells and particularly in offshore and inaccessible wells  a wireline retrievable gas lift valve and mandrel are illustrated in    fig        while a tubing retrievable valve and mandrel are shown in    fig        api spec    v   specification for gas lift

to stabilize the fluid level in the casing annulus and prevent injection gas from blowing around the lower end of the tubing in wells with a low flowing bottomhole pressure  a closed gas lift installation implies that the installation includes a packer and a standing valve  an installation without a standing valve may be referred to as semiclosed  and this is widely used for continuous flow operations  an installation without a packer or standing valve is called an open installation  an open installation is seldom recommended   a packer is required for gas lifting low bottomhole pressure wells to isolate the injection gas in the casing annulus and to control the gas volume per cycle for intermittent lift operations  intermittent gas lift operations require a packer and possibly a standing valve  although most illustrations of an intermittent gas lift installation show a standing valve  many actual installations do not include this valve  if the permeability of the well is very low  the need for a standing valve is optional  the advantages of a packer are particularly important for gas lift installations in an area where the injection gas line pressure varies or the injection gas supply is interrupted periodically  if the installation does not include a packer  the well must be unloaded after each shutdown  more damage to gas lift valves can occur during unloading operations than during any other time in the life of a gas lift installation  if the injection gas line pressure varies  the working fluid level changes  the result is a liquid washing action through all valves below the working fluid level  and this continuing fluid transfer can eventually fluid cut the seat assembl

compressive strength is less than       psi  commonly produce formation sand or fines with fluids  these formations are usually geologically young  tertiary age  and shallow  and they have little or no natural cementation  sand production is unwanted because it can plug wells  erode equipment  and reduce well productivity  it also has no economic value  nonetheless  formation sand production from wells is dealt with daily on a global basis  in certain producing regions  sand control completions are the dominant type and result in considerable added expense to operations       fluid flow      fluid flow from wells is the consequence of the wellbore pressure being smaller than that in the reservoir  the drag force caused by the flow from large to small pressure is related to the velocity viscosity product at any point around the well  hence  when fluids flow toward the wellbore  the tendency is for some of the formation material to flow concurrently with the fluids _      restraining forces      opposing the fluid forces are the restraining forces that hold the formation sand in place  these consist of natural cementation  compressive strength   friction between sand grains  fluid pressure in the pores of the rock  and capillary forces  the compressive strength of the rock  the primary restraint  is controlled by intergranular cementation that is a secondary geologic process  as a general rule  old sediments are more consolidated than are younger sediments  young formations commonly have little cementing material and are referred to as being poorly consolidated  stated another way  they have low compressive strength  their compressive strengths are usually less than       psi and may even be so small that their strengths can not be measured  the frictional forces are related to the confining or overburden stresses  the stress that causes the rock to fail includes the mechanical stress that results from the overburden and the drag forces associated from viscous flow of fluids through the rock matrix  the overburden stress is partially supported by the pore pressure  so the net stress  the cause of rock failure  the effective stress  is the difference between the overburden stress and the pore pressure  capillary forces also can contribute to sand production  there are numerous examples where sand production occurred when water production began  sand arches form  on occasion  around the perforations  the questions of when and how arches form are related to the flow rate  the compressive strength of the formation  and the size of the sand and the perforations     fig         portrays an arch and the balance between viscous and restraining forces  unfortunately  sand arches are not stable  and their transient behavior cannot be relied upon for controlling sand production  file vol  page     image      png    fig        geometry of a stable arch surrounding a perforation     the previous discussion is an oversimplification of the problem  and there are other related factors  think in terms of sand production being related to the production rate  the pressure reduction around the well  and the compressive strength of the formation  if the forces caused by fluid flow exceed the restraining forces  formation sand is produced      consequences of sand production     the consequences of sand production are always detrimental to the short long term productivity of the well  although some wells routinely experience manageable sand production  these are the exception rather than the rule  in most cases  attempting to manage sand production over the life of the well is not an attractive or prudent operating alternative       accumulation downhole      if the production velocity in well tubulars is insufficient to transport sand to the surface  it will begin to fill the inside of the casing  eventually  the producing interval may be completely covered with sand  in this case  the production rate will decline until the well becomes  quot sanded up quot  and production ceases  in situations like this  remedial operations are required to clean out the well and restore productivity  one cleanout technique is to run a  quot bailer quot  on a wireline to remove the sand from the production tubing or casing  because the bailer removes only a small volume of sand at a time  multiple wireline runs are necessary to clean out the well  another cleanout operation involves running a smaller diameter tubing string or coiled tubing down into the production tubing to agitate the sand and lift it out of the well by circulating fluid  the inner string is progressively lowered while circulating the sand out of the well  this operation must be performed cautiously to avoid the possibility of sticking the inner string inside the production tubing  if the production of sand is continuous  the cleanout operations may be required period

several time increments during each flow period  the times at which the pressures are measured should be the same relative to the beginning of each flow period  because less time is required to build to essentially initial pressure after short flow periods than to reach stabilized flow at each rate in a flow after flow test  the isochronal test is more practical for low permeability formations  a final stabilized flow point often is obtained at the end of the test     fig       illustrates an isochronal test    file vol  page      image      png    fig        pressure and flow rate history of a typical isochronal test       the isochronal test is based on the principle that the radius of drainage established during each flow period depends only on the length of time for which the well is flowed and not the flow rate  consequently  the pressures measured at the same time periods during each different rate correspond to the same transient radius of drainage  under these conditions  isochronal test data can be analyzed using the same theory as a flow after flow test  even though stabilized flow is not attained  in theory  a stabilized deliverability curve can be obtained from transient data if a single  stabilized rate and the corresponding bhp have been measured and are available   the transient flow regime is modeled by  rtenotitle                         where   p    s   is the stabilized bhp measured before the test  the transient equation can be rewritten in a form similar to the stabilized equation for a circular drainage area  to start this process  write  rtenotitle                         further  a transient radius of drainage is defined as  rtenotitle                         by substituting    eq       into    eq       and rearranging  the transient solution becomes  rtenotitle                         which is valid at any   fixed   time because   r    d   is a function of time and not of flow rate    r    d   has no rigorous physical significance  it is simply the radius that forces the transient equation to resemble the pseudosteady state equation  in addition  do not confuse   r    d   with   r    i    which is the transient radius of investigation given by    eq         rtenotitle                         similar to houpeurt   s equations  rewrite    eq       as  rtenotitle                         where  rtenotitle                         and rtenotitle                           b   is not a function of time and will remain constant  similarly  the intercept   a    t   is constant for each fixed time line or isochron   the theory of isochronal test analysis implies that the transient pressure drawdowns corresponding to the same elapsed time during each different flow period will plot as straight lines with the same slope   b    the intercept a t for each line will increase with increasing time  therefore  draw a line with the same slope    b    through the final  stabilized data point  and use the coordinates of the stabilized point and the slope to calculate a stabilized intercept    a    independent of time  where  for radial flow  the stabilized flow coefficient is defined by  rtenotitle                            rawlins schellhardt analysis     in logarithmic form  the empirical equation introduced by rawlins and schellhardt for analysis of flow after flow test data is  rtenotitle                          for isochronal tests  plot transient data measured at different flow rates but taken at the same time increments relative to the beginning of each flow period  the lines drawn through data points corresponding to the same fixed flow time prove to be parallel  so the value of n is constant and independent of time  however  the intercept  log    c     is a function of time  so a different intercept must be calculated for each isochronal line  this  quot transient quot  intercept is log      c    t     in terms of this transient intercept     eq        becomes  rtenotitle

obtain a higher production rate from the well  this can be done with a positive displacement downhole pump  such as a beam pump or a progressive cavity pump  pcp   to lower the flowing pressure at the pump intake  it also can be done with a downhole centrifugal pump  which could be a part of an electrical submersible pump  esp  system  a lower bottomhole flowing pressure and higher flow rate can be achieved with gas lift in which the density of the fluid in the tubing is lowered and expanding gas helps to lift the fluids  artificial lift can be used to generate flow from a well in which no flow is occurring or used to increase the flow from a well to produce at a higher rate  most oil wells require artificial lift at some point in the life of the field  and many gas wells benefit from artificial lift to take liquids off the formation so gas can flow at a higher rate      types of artificial lift     the major forms of artificial lift are    sucker rod  beam  pumping  electrical submersible pumping  esp   gas lift and intermittent gas lift  reciprocating and jet hydraulic pumping systems  plunger lift  progressive cavity pumps  pcp   there are other methods  such as the electrical submersible progressive cavity pump  espcp  for pumping solids and viscous oils  in deviated wells  this system has a pcp with the motor and some other components similar to an esp  other methods include    modifications of beam pump systems  various intermittent gas lift methods  various combination systems      usage of artificial lift systems     there are approximately   million oil wells in operation worldwide  more than   million wells use some type of artificial lift  more than         of the lifted wells use sucker rod pumps  in the us  sucker rod pumps lift approximately         wells  approximately     of all us oil wells are stripper wells making less than    b d with some water cut  the vast majority of these stripper wells are lifted with sucker rod pumps  of the nonstripper    higher    volume wells      are rod pumped      are gas lifted  and the remainder are lifted with esps  hydraulic pumps  and other methods of lift  these statistics indicate the dominance of rod pumping for onshore operations  for offshore and higher rate wells around the world  the use of esps and gas lift is much higher      selecting an artificial lift system     to realize the maximum potential from developing any oil or gas field  the most economical artificial lift method must be selected  the methods historically used to select the lift method for a particular field vary broadly across the industry  the methods include    operator experience  what methods are available for installations in certain areas of the world  what is working in adjoining or similar fields  determining what methods will lift at the desired rates and from the required depths  evaluating lists of advantages and disadvantages     expert    systems to both eliminate and select systems  evaluation of initial costs  operating costs  production capabilities  etc  with the use of economics as a tool of selection  usually on a present value basis  these methods consider    geographic location  capital cost  operating cost  production flexibility  reliability     mean time between failures     in most cases  what has worked best or which lift method performs best in similar fields serve as selection criteria  also  the equipment and services available from vendors can easily determine which lift method will be applied  however  when significant costs for well servicing and high production rates are a part of the scenario  it becomes prudent for the operator to consider most  if not all  of the available evaluation and selection methods  see artificial lift selection methods  if the    best    lift method is not selected  such factors as long term servicing costs  deferred production during workovers  and excessive energy costs  poor efficiency  can reduce drastically the net present value  npv  of the project  typically  the reserves need to be produced in a timely manner with reasonably low operating costs  conventional wisdom considers the best artificial lift method to be the system that provides the highest present value for the life of the project  good data are required for a complete present value analysis  and these data are not always broadly available   environmental and geographical considerations may be overriding issues  for example  sucker rod pumping is  by far  the most widely used artificial lift method in onshore us operations  however  in a densely populated city or on an offshore platform with    wells in a very small deck area  sucker rod pumping might be a poor choice  also  deep wells producing several thousands of barrels per day cannot be lifted by beam lift  other methods must be considered  such geographic  environmental  and produc

advantages and issues     bullhead injection of a simple aqueous solution containing a water soluble polymer to treat conformance problems  such as excessive water production  in matrix rock  unfractured  reservoirs is a highly appealing concept  most dpr polymers  also known as rpm polymers  are not usually highly exotic or costly  thus  polymer alone dpr treatments for reducing excessive water production are much simpler and less risky  in concept  than conducting the same task using a relatively strong total shutoff gel  particularly a    strong    crosslinked polymer gel  a polymer solution alone poses less risk of totally sealing off the treated reservoir volume compared with injecting a water shutoff gel  the chemical and operational aspects of injecting a polymer solution for water shutoff reduction purposes are substantially less complicated than injecting a comparable polymer gel   however  polymer dpr water shutoff and or water reduction treatments do have a number of significant limitations  in addition to those already discussed in disproportionate permeability reduction    how fast will the treatment polymer be desorbed and flow back to the production well   dpr polymer treatments for conformance improvement are normally successful only when applied to matrix rock oil reservoirs with a relatively low permeability  usually less than   darcy   in addition  many existing dpr polymer conformance improvement treatments are only applicable to sand and sandstone reservoirs  dpr polymer conformance improvement treatments are not directly applicable within

mathematical statement and how mathematical analysis can be used to answer transient flow problems  this broad area is common to many other disciplines  such as heat conduction in solids and groundwater hydrology  the objective of this chapter is to introduce the fundamentals of transient analysis  present examples  and guide the interested reader to relevant references __toc__     introduction     most physical phenomena in the domain of transient fluid flow in porous media can be described generally by partial differential equations  pdes   with appropriate boundary conditions and sometimes with simplifying assumptions  the pde leads to an initial boundary value problem  ibvp  that is solved to find a mathematical statement of the resulting flow in the porous medium  this section briefly discusses the statement of the ibvp for transient fluid flow in porous media       equations of transient fluid flow in porous media      in essence  fluid motion in porous media can be specified by the knowledge of the velocity vector  rtenotitle  and the density of the fluid          as a function of the position    x      y      z    and time    t    that is  rtenotitle

where   v    x      v    y    and   v    z   are the velocity components  and rtenotitle  rtenotitle  and rtenotitle are the unit vectors in the   x      y    and   z   directions  respectively the physical law governing the macroscopic fluid flow phenomena in porous media is the conservation of mass  which states that mass is neither created nor destroyed  the mathematical formula of this rule is developed by considering the flow through a fixed arbitrary closed surface      lying entirely within a porous medium of porosity         which is filled with a fluid of viscosity            fig         illustrates an arbitrary closed surface in porous medium  file vol  page     image      png    fig          arbitrary closed surface    in porous medium     the conservation of mass principle requires that the difference between the rates at which fluid enters and leaves the volume through its surface must equal the rate at which mass accumulates within the volume  the total mass within the volume at any time is given byrtenotitle                         then  the time rate of change of mass within    isrtenotitle                         which  by the conservation of mass law  is equal to the rate at which mass enters   v   through the surface consider the differential surface element  d    shown in    fig          the mass entering the volume through d   at the normal

       accounts for both influx and outflux through the surface of the volume  that is      m    g   is the difference between the masses entering and leaving the control volume during the time increment      t    then  the mass rate entering the volume    v    through its surface      can be written asrtenotitle                         by the principle of conservation of mass  equating the right sides of    eqs         and           yieldsrtenotitle                         a more useful relation is found with the divergence theorem  which states that the flux of rtenotitle through the closed surface      is identical to the volume integral of rtenotitle  the divergence of rtenotitle  taken throughout   v    that is rtenotitle                         here      is the gradient

only if its argument is zero  because the volume integral in    eq          is identically zero for any arbitrarily chosen volume   then  the following continuity equation can be obtained rtenotitle                             eq          is a pde that is equivalent to the statement of the conservation of mass for fluid flow in porous media  for practical purposes  however     eq          is

their home countries out into the world  the worldwide scope of the exploration for the production of oil and gas has led to the rise of international and multinational petroleum companies   companies that are nominally based in a home country but operate throughout the world  today  almost all major oil companies have a presence in most oil producing regions  and many midsize and smaller petroleum companies operate in more than one country each host country has its own specific laws and regulations that apply to oil and gas development in that country  still  it is possible to describe some common approaches and concepts that apply to international petroleum law  the united states has also passed certain laws that apply to the international operations of u s  companies  this chapter

the     s  in the early     s  standard oil company of new jersey held a near monopoly on domestic oil supply and price  specific judicial and legislative action by the united states government caused this monopoly to break up  and various large  integrated oil companies were formed  which participated in all petroleum industry segments from exploration to marketing  these major companies sought mineral development opportunities both domestically and abroad  at the same time  european oil companies also sought to capitalize on mineral development opportunities beyond their borders yergin  d

  the prize  the epic quest for oil  money and power  simon and schuster  new york city         initially  these major companies  from the united states and europe  sought rights in oil from countries in the middle east by means of concessions  which authorized the company to explore  develop  and market the oil from certain lands for a specified period of time  the concession area might have covered the entire country  such as abu dhabi or kuwait  the concession period could have lasted decades  such as    years for abu dhabi and kuwait or    years for saudi arabia  the concession might not have contained development obligations  as the concession might have been viewed as a transfer of the mineral rights for a term of years  and the developing company might have had unilateral control over all management and decisions associated with the concession smith  e   et al   international petroleum transactions  rocky mountain mineral law foundation  denver        chaps         these concessions were granted by the government or sovereign of the host country  who was often subject to strong internal or foreign political pressures  in exchange for granting the concession  the host country typically received an initial or bonus payment and a right to some fractional share of  or a royalty interest in the value of  the oil produced  in these early development years  produced natural gas was generally considered a waste byproduct and was vented or flared although some host countries may have only granted limited or relatively short lived concession agreements  others granted broadly scoped rights  which left the host country with little control over what might have been that country   s most valuable single asset  in an effort to regain control over their mineral resources  countries such as mexico  saudi arabia  and iran resorted to expropriation and nationalization of the petroleum rights by pemex  saudi aramco  and the national oil company of iran

the evolution of a technology  spe journal of petroleum technology                  spe       ms   documented the evolution of hydraulic fracturing in high permeability reservoirs since the     s  the first fracture treatments in the     s were pumped in moderate  to high permeability formations  those treatments were designed to remove formation damage that usually occurred during the drilling and completion operations  low permeability reservoirs were fracture treated in the     s and     s  but  at low oil and gas prices  low permeability reservoirs were generally not economic  even after a successful fracture treatment      overview     the values of high  moderate  and low permeability need to be defined on the basis of both the formation permeability and the reservoir fluid viscosity  or the   k      ratio  where   k   is the formation permeability in md  and        is the formation fluid viscosity in cp  for a gas well  the average viscosity of the gas is assumed to be approximately      cp  for a typical gas well    a low permeability formation might be where   k       md  a medium permeability reservoir might be    gt    k   gt    md  a high permeability reservoir might be    md gt    k    if the formation contains oil with a fluid viscosity of   cp  then all the permeability values must be multiplied by a factor of     to determine what is a low   moderate   and high permeability formation  this example illustrates that the definition of  quot high permeability quot  also depends on the value of the reservoir fluid viscosity  in heavy oil plays  in which the reservoir fluid viscosity is several thousand centipoises  then formations with several darcies permeability would be considered a low permeability reservoir  from this point forward  we assume that the formation fluid is either gas or light oil  thus  a formation with a permeability of several hundred millidarcies or more will be considered high permeability      candidate selection

increase the back stress on the formation  to control sand production  to reduce fines migration  to reduce asphaltene deposition  to reduce water coning  as mentioned  the early fracture treatments were pumped to break through damage near the wellbore and increase the productivity index of the formation  today  fracture treatments in high permeability wells are pumped to bypass damage  but other reasons have become just as important  for example  many treatments are pumped for sand control purposes  by creating a short  highly conductive fracture connecting the reservoir to the wellbore  the productivity index is increased  thus  more oil and gas can be produced with a lower drawdown  as the drawdown is reduced  the tendency of a poorly consolidated reservoir to produce sand is also reduced  in certain formations  the reduction in drawdown also helps to deter    fines migration  asphaltene deposition  water coning     design considerations for high permeability formations

unstable formations  spe form eval                spe       pa   a tip screenout design is one in which the pad volume is designed carefully so that the pad leaks off during the treatment  causing the propping agent to bridge at the tip of the fracture near the end of the job  at this point  the fracture quits growing in length  but pumping continues  as pumping continues  the pressure in the fracture increases  which leads to increasing width and  sometimes  increasing height  the fracture continues to inflate and is packed with the propping agent  the purpose of a tip screenout design is

lift application and installation design methods  the following topic describes the various types of gas lift valves and crossover seats currently used in the industry      unbalanced  single element gas lift valves     the unbalanced  single element gas lift valve is essentially an unbalanced pressure regulator  the analogy between these two devices is apparent in    fig        where    a  injection pressure operated gas lift valve and backpressure regulator responds to injection gas pressure and upstream pressure  respectively   b  production pressure  fluid  operated gas lift valve and downstream pressure regulator respond to flowing production pressure and downstream pressure  respectively   the closing force for a gas lift valve can be a gas pressure charge in the bellows exerted over the effective bellows area or a spring force  or a combination of both  the closing force for the regulator or gas lift valve can be adjusted to maintain a desired backpressure for injection pressure operation  the regulator or valve remains closed until this set closing force is exceeded    file vol  page     image      png    fig    analogy of unbalanced  single element  bellows charged gas lift valves to unbalanced back pressure and downstream pressure regulators       generally  the major initial opening force for a gas lift valve is the pressure exerted over the effective bellows area minus the port area  and the lesser opening force is the pressure acting over the port area  in like manner  the major opening pressure for a pressure regulator is applied over an area equal to the diaphragm area minus the port area  the effect of the unbalanced opening force is far less for most unbalanced backpressure and pressure reducing regulators than for gas lift valves  the reason is that the ratio of the port area to the total effective bellows area of a gas lift valve is much greater than the ratio of the port area to the total diaphragm area for most regulators  the operating principle remains identical for the gas lift valve and regulator  but the pressure applied over the port area has greater effect on the initial opening pressure of most gas lift valves      pilot operated gas lift valves     there are numerous special application gas lift valves available  the operation of many of these unique valves can be analyzed using the static force balance equations for the unbalanced  single element  gas lift valve  the many different types of gas lift valves and the variation in calculations are not discussed in this section because of their limited application  however  one special purpose valve of particular importance is the pilot operated gas lift valve   the pilot operated gas lift valve in    fig       has operating characteristics that are ideally suited for chamber installations and deep intermittent gas lift operations with low injection gas operating pressure and small tubing in large casing  the pilot valve offers a very large main port with controlled spread and a predictable constant closing pressure  spread is defined as the difference between the initial valve opening and closing pressures  this type of valve functions properly on time cycle or choke control of the injection gas  the pilot section operates in the same manner as a single element gas lift valve with a small choke located downstream of the valve seat  the production pressure at valve depth is exerted over the ball seat contact area of the pilot section as an initial opening force  when the pilot section begins to open  an increase in pressure occurs between the pilot valve seat and the main valve piston  this increase in pressure above the piston results in compression of the spring under the piston  and the main valve snaps open  an exceedingly high  instantaneous  injection gas rate enters the tubing through the large main valve port  as the injection gas pressure in the casing decreases from gas passage through the large main port  the pilot section begins to close  the pressure downstream of the pilot port remains approximately equal to the injection gas pressure until the pilot port area open to injection gas flow becomes less than the bleed hole area in the main valve piston  when the pressure across the piston approaches equalization  the spring returns the main valve to its seat    file vol  page     image      png    fig    pilot operated gas lift valve       the closing pressure of a pilot valve is considered predictable because it is approximately equal to the theoretical closing pressure of an unbalanced  single element gas lift valve  the pressure upstream and downstream of the pilot port is approximately equal at the instant the pilot section closes  selecting the proper pilot port size controls the spread of a pilot valve  the high injection gas throughput capacity of the large main valve port is unaffected by the pi

completion systems vary from relatively simple single zone low pressure low temperature  lp lt  designs to complex high pressure high temperature  hp ht  applications that were unthinkable with the technology available    years ago  many of the basic components appear similar to those used in the past  yet they have been vastly improved  and their performance has been optimized to suit numerous environments there are several keys to designing a successful completion system and selecting components that are fit for purpose for both the downhole environment and application  consideration must be given to the various modes under which the completion must operate and the effects any changes in temperature or differential pressure will have on the tubing string and packer  ultimately  the system must be both efficient and cost effective to achieve production and financial goals  a key factor in the completion design is the production rate  see other chapters in this section of the handbook for additional information on this topic  the intention of this chapter is to familiarize the reader with the common components that make up the completion system and to understand their applications and constraints __toc__     packers     the packer forms the basis of the cased hole completion design  the packer is a sealing device that isolates and contains produced fluids and pressures within the wellbore to protect the casing and other formations above or below the producing zone  this is essential to the basic functioning of most wells in addition to providing a seal between the tubing and casing  other benefits of a packer are as follows    prevent downhole movement of the tubing string   support some of the weight of the tubing   often improve well flow and production rate   protect the annular casing from corrosion from produced fluids and high pressures   provide a means of separation of multiple producing zones   limit well control to the tubing at the surface for safety purposes   hold well servicing fluid  kill fluids  packer fluids  in the casing annulus   packers have four key features  slip  cone  packing element system  and body or mandrel  the slip is a wedge shaped device with wickers  or teeth  on its face  which penetrate and grip the casing wall when the packer is set  the cone is beveled to match the back of the slip and forms a ramp that drives the slip outward and into the casing wall when setting force is applied to the packer  once the slips have anchored into the casing wall  additional applied setting force energizes the packing element system and creates a seal between the packer body and the inside diameter of the casing production packers can be classified into two groups  retrievable and permanent  permanent packers can be removed from the wellbore only by milling  the retrievable packer may or may not be resettable  however  removal from the wellbore normally does not require milling  retrieval is usually accomplished by some form of tubing manipulation  this may necessitate rotation or require pulling tension on the tubing string the permanent packer is fairly simple and generally offers higher performance in both temperature and pressure ratings than does the retrievable packer  in most instances  it has a smaller outside diameter  od   offering greater running clearance inside the casing string than do retrievable packers  the smaller od and the compact design of the permanent packer help the tool negotiate through tight spots and deviations in the wellbore  the permanent packer also offers the largest inside diameter  id  to make it compatible with larger diameter tubing strings and monobore completions the retrievable packer can be very basic for lp lt applications or very complex in hp ht applications  because of this design complexity in high end tools  a retrievable packer offering performance levels similar to those of a permanent packer will invariably cost more  however  the ease of removing the packer from the wellbore and features such as resettability and being able to reuse the packer often may outweigh the added cost before selecting either tool  it is important to consider the performance and features of each design  as well as the application in which it will be used  perhaps in some instances  the permanent packer is the only option  as may be the case in some hp ht applications  however  in those instances in which either will suffice  the operator must decide which features offer the best return over the life of the well when selecting a packer for a cased hole completion  the differential pressure and temperature requirements of the application must be considered  the well depth  deployment and setting method desired  and final tubing landing conditions are also factors that come into play  the various operational modes  flowing  shut in  injection  and stimu

properly  some of these items and activities include appropriate drilling practices  cleanliness  completion fluids  perforating  perforation cleaning  acidizing  and or specifications for rig and service company personnel      drilling practices     the productivity of a cased  or openhole gravel packed completion is determined in part by the condition of the reservoir behind the filter cake  the quality of the filter cake  and the stability of the wellbore  given this  it can be said that the completion begins when the bit enters the pay  thus  it follows that the goal of drilling is to maintain wellbore stability while minimizing formation damage      maintaining wellbore stability     wellbore stability in the form of washouts  hole collapse  and fracturing is an effect of    large drilling fluid loss  inadequate overbalance  reaction between filtrate and the formation  but  for whatever reason  instability affects both cased  and openhole completions because it can cause loss of the wellbore  thick cement sheaths in washed out sections result in poor to no perforation penetration and the lack of cement can make sand placement difficult  hole collapse can prevent running screens to the bottom of the hole  failure  in the form of fracturing or collapse  can stop an openhole gravel pack  should failure occur while the pack is in process   because stability is an effect of the reaction between the drill in fluid and the formation  the following factors become key parameters in building a drill in fluid    filtrate  filter cake  weight  rheology  these variables usually can be addressed by using polymers and fluid loss agents in a brine based fluid containing a properly sized bridging agent like that contained in special drill in fluids      formation damage     formation damage  expressed quantitatively in the form of skin  depends on    filtrate used  particle damage  filter cake quality  for openhole gravel packs   skin  in turn  is a reflection of poor productivity  it is expensive to remove or bypass  preservation of reservoir pore throats requires    keeping particles out of pores  minimizing filtrate loss  employing a filtrate that is compatible with rock and reservoir fluids  with openhole completions  filtrate must be nondamaging  but it is generally overlooked in cased hole completions  frequently  it is assumed that any damage caused by filtrate will be bypassed with perforating  looking at the occasions when reservoirs are exposed to moderate to high fluid losses  often expressed as a    thirsty mud     it is possible to have filtrate invade   to   ft from the wellbore  if the filtrate is incompatible with reservoir rock and fluid  there will be a damaged ring beyond which it may be impossible for perforations to penetrate  for openhole completions  the quality of the filter cake is also as important as the other requirements  because the cake must be gravel packed into place  it is necessary that the cake be thin and friable and have a low breakout pressure   again  as with the wellbore stability issue  filtrate and filter cake become key parameters  proper selection of a filtrate brine base  along with polymers and fluid loss agents containing a properly sized bridging agent  usually meets these needs      cleaning the casing  openhole  and work string     cleanliness may be one of the most important considerations for gravel packing  because a gravel pack represents the installation of a downhole filter  any action that promotes plugging the gravel pack is detrimental to well productivity  many advances have been made in improving the cleanliness of gravel pack operations  particularly in completion fluids  however  in spite of the fact that clean completion fluids are used  the lack of cleanliness in the casing  work string  lines  pits  and other equipment is a source of potential formation damage  while cleaning the well and rig equipment can be expensive  it is not as expensive as lost productivity or having to rework the entire completion because proper cleaning was neglected in the beginning       casing      reverse circulation is the preferred method of circulation for cleaning the casing  the recommended annular velocity is a minimum of     ft min for casing shoe deviations less than      and     ft min for wellbore deviations greater than       reverse circulation is more effective than conventional circulating  as material is moved downhole with the gravity where it is more efficiently circulated to the surface because of higher velocities in the work string than in the annulus  for an openhole completion  reverse circulation permits cleaning the casing to specifications before addressing the open hole  planning for a work string that will permit reverse circulation at reasonable bottomhole pressures is required   to clean the casing  the following cleaning agents shou

at various ranges of temperature and pressure within a reservoir  ternary phase diagrams represent the phase behavior of mixtures containing three components in a triangular diagram      properties of ternary diagrams     phase behavior of mixtures containing three components is represented conveniently on a triangular diagram such as those shown in    fig        such diagrams are based on the property of equilateral triangles that the sum of the perpendicular distances from any point to each side of the diagram is a constant equal to the length of any of the sides  thus  the composition of a point in the interior of the triangle can be calculated as  rtenotitle                         where  rtenotitle                         several other useful properties of triangular diagrams are a consequence of this fact  for mixtures along any line parallel to a side of the diagram  the fraction of the component of the corner opposite to that side is constant     fig   b      in addition  mixtures lying on any line connecting a corner with the opposite side contain a constant ratio of the components at the ends of the side     fig   c      finally  mixtures of any two compositions

wsd  approach  which is based on multipliers called safety factors  sfs   the primary role of a safety factor is to account for uncertainties in the design variables and parameters  primarily the load effect and the strength or resistance of the structure  while based on experience  these factors give no indication of the probability of failure of a given structure  as they do not explicitly consider the randomness of the design variables and parameters  moreover  the safety factors tend to be rather conservative  and most limits of design are established using failure criteria based on elastic theory      design methodology     reliability based approaches are probabilistic in nature and explicitly identify all the design variables and parameters that determine the load effect and strength of the structure  moreover  they use a limit states approach to the design of tubulars  rather than elasticity based initial yield criteria to predict structural failure  such probabilistic design methodologies allow either the computation of the probability of failure  p  f    of a given structure or the design of a structure that meets a target probability of failure   reliability based techniques have been formally applied to the design of load bearing structures in several disciplines  however  their application to the design of oilfield tubulars is relatively new  two different reliability based approaches have been considered  the more fundamental quantitative risk assessment  qra  approach and the more easily applied load and resistance factor design  lrfd  format  comparison of sf to the estimated design reliability offers a reliability based interpretation of wsd and gives insight into the design reliabilities implicit in wsd      background     in all design procedures  a primary goal is to ensure that the total load effect of the applied loads is lower than the strength of the tubular to withstand that particular load effect  given the uncertainty in the estimate of the load effect  resistance  and their relationship   the load effect is related to the resistance of the tubular by means of a relationship  often known as the    failure criterion     which is thought to represent the limit of the tubular under that particular load effect  thus  the failure criterion is specific to the response of the tubular to that load effect  three conventional design procedures are considered  wsd  qra  and lrfd   clearly  the relationship between the load effect and resistance and the means of ensuring safety or reliability are different in each of these procedures  in what follows  z  i   are the variables and parameters  such as tension  pressure  diameter  yield stress  etc   that determine the load effect and resistance  q is the total load effect  and r is the total resistance in response to the load effect  q      working stress design  wsd      wsd is the conventional casing design procedure  that is  the familiar deterministic approach to the design of oilfield tubulars  in wsd  the load effect is separated from the resistance by means of an arbitrary multiplier  the sf  the estimated load effect is often the worst case load  q  w    based on deterministic design values for the parameters  z  i    that determine the load effect  the estimated resistance is often the minimum resistance  rmin  based on deterministic design values for the parameters that determine the resistance  the design values chosen in formulating the resistance are such that the resulting resistance is a minimum  in most cases  the limits of design are established using failure criteria based on elastic theory  in some cases  such as collapse  wsd employs empirical failure criteria  in general  the design procedure can be represented by the relationship  rtenotitle                         the ratio rmin sf is called the safe working stress of the structure  hence  the name of the procedure   the role of the sf is to account for uncertainties in the design variables and parameters  primarily the load effect and the strength or resistance of the structure  the magnitude of the sf is usually based on experience  though little documentation exists on their origin or impact  different companies use different acceptable sfs for their tubular design  sfs give little indication of the probability of failure of a given structure  as they do not explicitly consider the randomness of the design variables and parameters  some other limitations of this approach are listed in brief next    wsd designs to worst case load  with no regard to the likelihood of occurrence of the load   wsd mostly uses conservative elasticity based theories and minimum strength in design  though this is not a requirement of wsd    wsd gives the engineer no insight into the degree of risk or safety  though the engineer assumes that it is acceptably low   thus makin

estimates of capital  reserves  and such economic yardsticks as npv net present value   quantifying that uncertainty with ranges of possible values and associated probabilities  i e   with probability distributions  helps everyone understand the risks involved  there is always an underlying model  such as a volumetric reserves estimate  a production forecast  a cost estimate  or a production sharing economics analysis  as we investigate the model parameters and assign probability distributions and correlations  we are forced to examine the logic of the model     the language of risk analysis is precise  it aids communication  reveals assumptions  and reduces mushy phrases and buzz words  this language requires study and most engineers have little exposure to probability and statistics in undergraduate programs      beyond that  we indicate some shortcomings of deterministic methods      aggregating base cases adding modes and medians  reserves  cost  time      deterministic reserve estimates are often described in terms of    low side possibilities  medium side possibilities  high side possibilities  some people think in terms of extremes  worst and best cases together with some base cases    mean  mode  median  others report values in terms of    p    p    p    sometimes  these cases are linked to such categories as    proved  proved plus probable  proved plus probable plus possible  while there is nothing wrong with any of these notions  the logic of obtaining the cases is often flawed  again  from murtha murtha  j a        monte carlo

shows how far off the total cost can be  take ten identical triangular distributions  each having           and     for low  most likely  mode   and high values  respectively  while the mode of each is      the mean is        summing these ten triangles gives  as usual  a new distribution that is approximately normal   this one with a mean of       and a standard deviation of approximately      the original mode       is approximately p    the sum of the modes is approximately p    far from what might be expected as a    representative value    for the distribution  in a       trial simulation  the p  and p   values are about       and           if the distributions represented    line item cost estimates  in other words  while there would be a     chance of exceeding the mode for any single estimate  there is an     chance   about   times out of     of exceeding the sum of the modes  if we added     items instead of just     the chance of exceeding the sum of modes is more than      we must be careful how we use most likely  modes  estimates for costs and reserves  of course  if there is significant positive correlation among the items  the aggregate distribution will be more dispersed and the above effect less pronounced         multiplying base cases or p  s  factors to yield reserves or resources      when volumetric products are used to obtain reserves estimates  there is a temptation to build the low side reserves estimate by blithely taking the product of low estimates for the various factors  this is a dangerous business at best  the product of p   estimates for area  pay  and recovery factor  for example  is approximately p   for special cases  all distributions log normal  no correlations   one can find an exact answer  but if you use a different distribution type  include any correlations between inputs  larger area tends to be associated with thicker pay   or change the number of factors  breaking out recovery factor into porosity

nor the modes for the inputs yield either p   or mode  respectively  for the output  except in very special cases  the mean values of inputs will yield the mean of the product distribution  but only if there is no correlation among inputs  in other words  even the    base case    reserves estimate  generally  should not be obtained from a product of base case inputs  except in very special cases

management  this include both the external geology of the reservoir     what created the hydrocarbon trap     and the internal geology of the reservoir     the nature of the rocks in which the hydrocarbons exist  this article focuses on what an engineer needs to know about the external and internal geology to understand the reservoir from which he or she is planning to produce hydrocarbons      need for understanding of geology     the efficient extraction of oil and gas requires that the reservoir be visualized in  d space  engineers need a conceptual model of reservoirs  conceptual models are an integral part of the decision making process  whether that process involves selecting perforations or forecasting future production  however  most engineering measurements made on reservoirs have little or no spatial information  for example  a core measurement has no dimensional information  wireline logs and continuous core measurements are  d  and production data and pressure information are volumetric but with unconstrained spatial information  geologic information  on the other hand  contains valuable spatial information that can be used to visualize the reservoir in  d space  therefore  engineers should understand the geologic data that can improve their conceptual model of the reservoir and  thus  their engineering decisions   the most important geologic information is the external geometry of the reservoir  defined by seals or flow barriers that inhibit the migration of hydrocarbons  forming a hydrocarbon trap  the buoyancy force produced by the difference in density between water and hydrocarbons drives migration  migration will cease  and a hydrocarbon reservoir will form  only where hydrocarbons encounter a trap  traps are composed of the following types of seals    top  lateral  bottom seals  the geometry of traps can have origins of the following types    structural  sedimentary  diagenetic  the second most important geologic information is the internal reservoir architecture  a reservoir is composed of rock types of varying reservoir quality that are systematically stacked  according to stratigraphic and diagenetic principles  the lateral distribution of depositional textures is related to depositional environments  and the vertical stacking of textures is described by stratigraphy  which is the geological study of the following aspects of rock strata    form  arrangement  geographic distribution  chronologic succession  classification  correlation  diagenesis  changes that happen to the sediment after deposition  can also control the lateral continuity and vertical stacking of reservoir rock types  this fact is most important in carbonate reservoirs  in which the conversion of limestone to dolostone and the dissolution of carbonate have a large effect on internal reservoir architecture   the basic concern for most engineers is the spatial distribution of petrophysical properties  such as    porosity  permeability  water saturation  relative permeability  to visualize the reservoir in petrophysical terms  the engineer must be able to equate measurements  log  core  or production  with geologic models because the measurements themselves do not contain spatial information  linking engineering measurements with geologic descriptions is best done at the rock fabric level because rock fabric controls pore size distribution  which  in turn  controls    porosity  permeability  capillary properties  rock fabrics can be tied directly to stratigraphic models and  thus  to  d space      external geometry reservoir traps     hydrocarbons are formed by anaerobic decomposition of organic matter that accumulates from the deposition of plankton in deep ocean basins  oil and gas are generated as the sediments are buried and the temperature rises  oil is the first hydrocarbon to be generated  followed by wet gas  and lastly by dry gas  once generated  oil and gas flow vertically and laterally through overlying sediments because of the density difference between hydrocarbons and formation water and they migrate through permeable formations until they encounter a reservoir trap in which oil and gas accumulate  oil will fill the traps first because it is first to be generated  higher temperatures resulting from continued burial cause gas to be generated  migrating gas will displace oil from the traps because gas has a lower density  the displaced oil will migrate further updip and fill any trap encountered hunt  j m        petroleum geochemistry and geology       san francisco  w h  freeman and co   traps filled with hydrocarbons are often referred to as pools  however  engineers normally use the term reservoir instead of pool for an oil and gas accumulation  a field is composed of one or more reservoirs in a single area  a trap is defined by the geometry of its seals  which are formations with very low per

that affects the trajectory of the bit and  consequently  of the wellbore      factors that determine drilling tendency of the bottom hole assembly  bha      in general  the factors that determine the drilling tendency of a bha are    bit side force  bit tilt  hydraulics  formation dip  formation rock properties  the bha design objective for directional control is to provide the directional tendency that will match the planned trajectory of the well      bit side force     the bit side force is the most important factor affecting the drilling tendency  the direction and magnitude of the bit side force determine the build  drop  and turn tendencies    drop assembly  when the bit side force acts toward the low side  build assembly  when the bit side force acts toward the high side of the hole  hold assembly  when the inclination side force at the bit is zero  bit tilt angle  the angle between the bit axis and the hole axis and affects the drilling direction because a drill bit is designed to drill barllel to its axis      rotary assemblies      note  rotary steerable assemblies are a notable exception to the comments below and are used as directional assemblies that can be steered and are used to build  drop  or hold angle and can be controlled from surface   rotary assemblies are designed to build  drop  or hold angle  the behavior of any rotary assembly is governed by the size and placement of stabilizers within the first     ft from the bit  additional stabilizers run higher on the drillstring will have limited effect on the assembly   s performance   rotary assemblies are not    steerable     first  the azimuth behavior  right left turn  of a rotary assembly is nearly uncontrollable  second  each rotary assembly has its own unique build drop tendency that cannot be adjusted from the surface  thus  tripping for the assembly change is required to correct the wellbore course   commonly used stabilizer types are    sleeve  welded blade  integral blade  for long wear life  geology is the most important consideration when selecting one type of stabilizer vs  another  sleeve stabilizers are most economical  but ruggedness often is an issue  welded blade stabilizers are best suited to large holes in soft formations  integral blade stabilizers are the most expensive but very rugged  making them the ideal choice in hard and abrasive formations  roller reamers are sometimes used with stabilizers to open the hole to full gauge  extend bit life  and prevent possible sticking problems       building assemblies  fulcrum principle      building assemblies use the fulcrum principle   a near bit stabilizer  closely placed above the bit  creates a pivot point wherein the bending drill collars force the near bit stabilizer to the low side of the hole and create a lateral force at the bit to the high side of the hole  experience has shown that the more limber the portion of the assembly just above the fulcrum  the faster the increase in angle   a typical build assembly uses two to three stabilizers  the first  near bit  stabilizer usually connects directly to the bit  if a direct connection is not possible  the distance between the bit and the first stabilizer should be less than   ft to ensure it remains an angle building assembly  the second stabilizer is added to increase the control of side force and to alleviate other problems   build rates can be increased by increasing the distance between the first and second stabilizers  when the distance between the stabilizers increases enough to cause the drill collar sag to touch the low side of the hole  the bit side force and bit tilt reach their maximum build rate for the assembly  generally  the drill collars will sag to touch the borehole wall when the distance between the stabilizers is greater than    ft  the amount of sag will also depend on the hole and collar sizes  inclination  stabilizer gauge  and weight on bit  wob    other important factors for the fulcrum assemblies are    inclination  wob  rotary speed  the build rate of a fulcrum assembly increases as inclination increases because the larger component of the collar   s own weight causes them the bend  increasing the wob will bend the drill collars behind the near bit stabilizer even more  increasing the build rate  a higher rotary speed tends to straighten out the drill collars  thus reducing the build rate  therefore  low rotary speeds     to     rev min  are generally used with fulcrum assemblies  sometimes  in soft formations  a high flow rate can lead to formation washout  resulting in decreased stabilizer contacts and  thus  a reduced build tendency       holding assemblies  packed hole      the packed hole assemblies contain three to five stabilizers properly spaced to maintain the angle  the increased stiffness on the bha from the added stabilizers keeps the drillstring from bending or

stimulation  initial production of a well is usually allowed to discharge to a surge pit to allow for cleanup of the wellbore of debris from drilling operations  if a well is self energized  it is also important to know whether the produced fluid remains single phase in the wellbore  friction losses are much greater for two phase flow  so increasing the casing diameter at the point where the fluid flashes to vapor will increase production  a well that does not discharge spontaneously will require stimulation  there are several methods of stimulation used      swabbing     this technique involves lowering a swab down the well  below the water or mud line  a one way valve in the swab permits the fluid to pass by the swab as it is lowered into the well  raising the swab lifts the water column out of the well to reduce the hydrostatic pressure on the producing formation so the well begins to discharge fluids spontaneously  this method may take several trips in and out of the well to initiate flashing and induce flow      coil tubing and liquid nitrogen     the removal of fluid from the top of the column can be achieved by running tubing into the well below the fluid level and injecting liquid nitrogen to lighten the column and induce boiling in the well  this method is the most common method of bringing a well back online after well remediation or surface facility shutdowns      compressed air     compressed air can be deployed instead of nitrogen and is preferred over swabbing  mainly for safety and well control reasons  standard air compressors are used in conjunction with drill pipe  the annulus is pressurized with air and the column of liquid is reverse circulated through the drill pipe      foaming agents     foaming agents help reduce the weight of the water column by emulsifying air or nitrogen in the liquid  thus keeping the gas entrained in the liquid and providing greater lift      decompression     this method has been used to stimulate water wells for agricultural purposes and is sometimes effective in starting a geothermal well  this method consists of pressurizing the wellbore with compressed air and quickly depressurizing the well to atmospheric pressure to induce boiling      pumped wells     if the well does not produce spontaneously and does not respond to stimulation or if the power production facility is designed to only handle geothermal liquids and not two phase or vapor flows  it will be necessary to install a pump  conventional technology for many years was a line shaft pump with the motor at the surface and the impeller set some distance below the drawdown water level in the well  this arrangement requires a straight  vertical wellbore down to the pump depth  there also may be restrictions on pump depth because line shaft pumps have limits on how far torque can be effectively transmitted down the wellbore  recently  high temperature capable submersible pumps have been developed that give good service up to about      c  the pump must be located at a depth sufficient to avoid cavitations at all flow rates expected      curtailments     curtailments are planned or unplanned circumstances that require wells to either be shut in completely or throttled  examples of curtailments include intentionally throttling production back during off peak power needs  load following   unexpected tripping of generation equipment  or other surface problems that may require forced outages  some wells may load up with liquid and stop flowing if any flow constraint is imposed  these wells might then require stimulation to restart production  in cases where short down time is expected  or to prevent the well from cooling  a plant bypass system might be installed at the surface to keep the well flowing  the bypass system can be a turbine bypass that passes the steam through a condenser  and the condensate back into the resource  or route steam to an atmospheric muffler system  when venting steam to atmosphere is a safety or environmental concern  a condensing system is generally used      injection     injection initially started as a disposal method but has more recently been recognized as an essential and important part of reservoir management  sustainable geothermal energy use depends on reinjection of produced fluid to enhance energy production and maintain reservoir pressure  a simple volumetric calculation shows that over     of the energy resides in the rock matrix  hence  failure to inject multiple pore volumes results in poor energy recovery efficiency  when the usable energy is extracted from the fluid  the spent fluids must be disposed  reused in a direct use application  or injected back into the resource  despite efforts to maximize the fraction of fluids reinjected  it is common for losses to approach      mainly through evaporative cooling tower loss  frequently  makeup water is use

that could cause fracturing or formation damage in the near wellbore area      estimates of least principal stress  s  from ballooning     ballooning is a process that occurs when wells are drilled with equivalent static mud weights close to the leakoff pressure  it occurs because during drilling  the dynamic mud weight exceeds the leakoff pressure  leading to near wellbore fracturing and seepage loss of small volumes of drilling fluid while the pumps are on  when the pumps are turned off  the pressure drops below the leakoff pressure  and the fluid is returned to the well as the fractures close  this process has been called    breathing    or    ballooning    because it looks like the well is expanding while circulating  and contracting once the pumps are turned off  this behavior can be identified on a pressure while drilling  pwd  log     fig    a     ward  c  and beique  m        pore and fracture pressure information from pwd data  presented at the aade drilling

indication to increase mud weight owing to the perception that it reveals gas pressures higher than the equivalent static mud weight   as shown in    fig    b     increasing the mud weight in a

ballooning is an important measure of least principal stress magnitude because it is essentially an inadvertent leakoff test conducted while drilling  the static mud weight is a lower bound on the magnitude of the least stress  and the dynamic mud weight is an upper bound  in some cases  a shut in break can be detected  which is a very accurate measure of the least stress  the only problem is that it can be difficult to identify the depth at which the ballooning incident took place  although it is reasonable to assume that it occurred close to the bit   this is a particular problem when there is a very long openhole interval  fortunately  it is often possible to find the location of the fractures created by the ballooning incident by a change in logging while drilling  lwd  resistivity recorded before and after the event      using wellbore failure to constrain the magnitude of shmax     once independent knowledge of sv and shmin is available  shmax can be determined from the widths of wellbore breakouts in vertical boreholes  because the stress concentration around the well and the rock strength are equal at the point of the maximum breakout width  it is possible to re arrange    eq       to solve for shmax  as shown in    fig        solving for shmax also requires a model for rock strength and knowledge of the pore pressure and mud weight  while the equations presented here are technically accurate only for elastic  brittle rock  utilizing the results to select the appropriate mud weight for drilling future wells requires only that the same model be

state  tensile failure is less likely in these faulting regimes unless a wellbore is inclined   to consider the potential for wellbore failure when a wellbore is inclined to the principal stresses  it is necessary to take into account the magnitudes and the orientations of the principal far field stresses  once these stress components are determined  in order to know whether a wellbore is likely to fail  the magnitudes of the stresses around the wellbore must be computed and the results considered in the context of a formal failure criterion  because the equations that describe the stress concentration around a well inclined to the principal stress axes are complicated  they are usually solved using a computer application designed for the purpose   the wellbore stress concentration decreases as a function of radial distance from the wellbore wall  thus  the zone of failed rock will only extend to a certain depth away from the well  once the rock has failed  however  the stresses are re concentrated around the now broken out wellbore  and it is possible  depending on the residual strength of the failed rock  which determines whether it can support stress  that additional failure will occur  one important thing to keep in mind is that even if the rock has failed  it may not lead to drilling diff

drawing of typical process equipment for sweetening sour gas with regenerative solvent is shown in    fig        the first vessel is the inlet separator  which performs the important function of separating the fluid phases on the basis of density difference between the liquid and the gas  the sour gas flows from the separator into the lower part of the absorber or contactor  this vessel usually contains    to    trays  but for small units  it could be a column containing packing  lean solution containing the sweetening solvent in water is pumped into the absorber near the top  as the

about    to    psig and at the solution boiling temperature  heat is applied from an external source  such as a steam reboiler  the liberated acid gas and any hydrocarbon gas not flashed off in the flash drum leave the still at the top  together with some solvent and a lot of water vapor  this stream of vapors is flowed through a condenser  usually an aerial cooler  to condense the solvent and water vapors  the liquid and gas mixture is flowed into a separator  normally referred to as a reflux drum  where the acid gas is separated from the condensed liquids  the liquids are pumped back into the top of the still as reflux  the gas stream  consisting mainly of h s and co   is generally piped to a sulfur recovery unit  the regenerated solution is flowed from the reboiler or the bottom of the still through the rich lean solution heat exchanger to a surge tank  from here  the solution is pumped through a cooler to adjust the temperature to the appropriate treating temperature in the absorber  the stream is then pumped with a high pressure pump back into the top of the absorber  to continue the sweetening of the sour gas   most solvent systems have a means of filtering the solution  this is accomplished by flowing a portion of the lean solution through a particle filter and sometimes a carbon filter as well  the purpose is to maintain a high degree of solution cleanliness to avoid solution foaming  some solvent systems also have a means of removing degradation products that involves maintaining an additional reboiler for this purpose in the regeneration

primary energy source  its use is projected to double between      and      energy information administration  eia         international energy outlook       us doe eia  washington  dc  may        the mix of fossil fuels used to provide energy and petrochemicals is shifting toward natural gas  or just  quot gas quot   and away from coal  natural gas is the more hydrogen rich fuel  the worldwide increase in demand for natural gas is driven by the abundance of natural gas reserves  continued technological advances in exploration and production  and the desire for low carbon fuels and cleaner air  the global demand for gas is increasing at more than twice the rate of oil demand  in the near future  one can envision an economy powered by gas  there are approximately     trillion m  of proven natural gas reserves available worldwide as of the year       bp        bp statistical review of world energy  bp plc  london  june           table        compares the worldwide fossil fuel reserves  at current consumption rates  the worldwide reserves to production ratio for gas is approximately    years  compared with    years for crude oil  file vol  page     image      png    table       worldwide fossil fuel reserves as of the year           many factors support the growth of the use of gas  natural gas is a clean burning fuel  it has a higher ratio of hydrogen to carbon compared with fuels like coal and oil  therefore  it releases less carbon dioxide per unit energy output compared with oil and coal  if sulfur is present in natural gas  it is removed at the source gas processing facility  therefore  natural gas combustion results in negligible sulfur dioxide emissions  additionally  natural gas can be burned with more controlled flame temperature compared with other fossil fuels  resulting in lower no  x   emissions  these inherent properties of natural gas make it the fuel of choice compared with coal and oil for achieving reductions in greenhouse emissions on the down side  the disadvantage of natural gas is that it is more expensive to transport  the calorific value of oil in relation to the volume it occupies  at ambient conditions  is       times greater than that of gas  fundamentally  it is this handicap that the oil and gas industry has to address for gas to fulfill its potential as the fuel of the near future  this limitation on gas usage is evident from the fact that only     of the world gas production is traded internationally vs      for oil  gas exploration has generally been limited by the cost to transport the gas to the market  hence  the current reserves of natural gas significantly underestimate the available gas resources  continued technology development is lowering the cost of production  which  when combined with advances in technology for transporting gas and gas based products to the market  has increased the focus on gas exploration  this is expected to lead to increasing gas reserves deliverable to the market  __toc__     associated and nonassociated gas     there are two primary sources of gas  associated gas reserves and nonassociated gas reserves  the economic drivers for monetizing gas from these two basic sources are quite different and are likely to lead to different gas utilization routes  hence  it is useful to understand the difference in economic characteristics of these two broad categories of gas sources  nonassociated gas reserves are developed primarily to produce natural gas  there may or may not be condensate production together with the gas  under these conditions  it is essential that there be a profitable market to which to deliver the gas associated gas is gas produced as a byproduct of the production of crude oil  associated gas reserves are typically developed for the production of crude oil  which pays for the field development costs  the reserves typically produce at peak levels for a few years and then decline  associated gas is generally regarded as an undesirable byproduct  which is either reinjected  flared  or vented  according to u s  energy information admin       statistics  energy information administration  eia         international energy annual       us doe eia  washington  dc  may        worldwide approximately    tcf yr of gas was flared  vented  or reinjected  the need to produce oil and dispose of natural gas  as is the case with associated gas  requires unique approaches in the field development plans  with increasing focus on sustainable development  flaring may cease to be an option  some countries have already legislated against gas flaring  for example  current nigerian policy requires all flaring to be eliminated by       this policy is expected to eliminate the waste of a valuable resource for nigeria and attendant negative impacts on the environment  consequently  several key gas utilization projects have either been recently

tools           gravel pack base     the first step in installing a gravel pack completion is to establish a base on which the screen will rest  in cased hole completions  the most common type base is a sump packer  the sump packer is normally run into the well on an electric wireline before perforating and is set a specified distance    to    ft  below the lowest planned perforation  the distance below the perforations must accommodate the length of the seal assembly and production screen overlap   although sump packers are the preferred gravel pack base  other options such as a bridge plug or cement plug can be used  in openhole completions  provisions for a debris sump or logging access can be achieved  but these are not routine and may not be feasible in some situations  therefore  the gravel pack base is normally a bull plug on the bottom of the screen  the types of common gravel pack bases are illustrated in    fig          file vol  page     image      png    fig      types of gravel pack bases  courtesy of baker oil tools           seal assembly     the seal assembly is required to establish a seal in the bore of the sump packer to prevent gravel pack sand from filling the bottom of the well during gravel packing  in the case of multiple gravel packs  the seal also provides for zonal isolation  the seal assembly used to engage the sump packer is normally a snap latch type or other type holddown      gravel pack screen     the purpose of the gravel pack screen is to create an annulus between the screen and the casing open hole and to hold the gravel in place during production  there are several different types of screens       screen centralization      filling the annulus between the screen casing  or open hole  with gravel pack sand is essential to the control of formation sand production  to ensure that the annulus is filled completely around the screen  centralization of the screen is required  in cased hole completions  weld on  blade type centralizers are normally used  the blades are approximately   in  long and are cut from a       to      in  thick plate or steel  the edges of the centralizers are beveled to ensure easy run in  the centralizers consist of four blades welded to the screen base pipe      apart to result in an outside diameter  od  approximately      in  under the inside diameter  id  of the well   s casing  the centralizers are spaced    to    ft apart and can be positioned at the top  bottom  and or middle of a screen joint as required   in openhole gravel packs  centralization is accomplished with bow spring centralizers  these centralizers consist of a top and bottom collar connected with   to   steel spring bows  the bows can be compressed  i e   the centralizer is elongated  for running through restricted ids  when the centralizer enters a larger id  the bows attempt to expand to their original position  resulting in a restoring force or centralization  sufficient centralizers are required such that the combined restoring force is capable of lifting the weight of the screen in the given hole conditions  computer programs are available for determining optimum centralizer spacing for a

problems of too wide well spacing and excessive tracer dispersion caused by layering that can occur with well to well tests  in the swct test  the tracer bearing fluid is injected into the formation through the test well and then produced back to the surface through the same well  the time required to produce the tracers back can be controlled by controlling the injected volume on the basis of available production flow rate from the test well      flow of tracers during a well test     in a single well test  tracers injected into a higher permeability layer will be pushed farther away from the well than those in a lower permeability layer  as indicated in    fig   a     however  the tracers in the higher permeability layer will have a longer distance to travel when flow is reversed  as the tracer profiles in    fig   b    show  the tracers from different layers will return to the test well at the same time  assuming that the flow is reversible in the various layers    file vol  page

different permeability       flow reversibility in a single well test is desirable for the reason just explained  but it complicates residual oil    s    or    measurement  the simple strategy of injecting two tracers with different partition coefficients does not work in this case  as    fig       shows  tracers a and b separate during injection  just as in a well to well test  and at the end of injection  tracer b will be farther from the wellbore than tracer a because the presence of the residual oil retards a  during production  then  tracer b has farther to travel to return to the well  the separation achieved during injection is reversed during back production  so that a and b arrive back at the wellbore at the same time  if they were injected at the same time   no measurement of   s    or   is possible using    eqs       and         because no information can be obtained about the ratio of velocities of a and b    file vol  page      image      png    fig        reversing

reversibility problem      one possible way of avoiding this reversibility problem is to generate the second tracer in the formation instead of injecting it  the steps are    inject tracer a and push it into the target formation  as described above  stop flow to allow part of the injected a to react  forming tracer b in the same pore space where a is located  after the reaction time  a and b are together  the fluid is then produced back into the test well  a and b must separate if their equilibrium distribution coefficients    k    a   and   k    b    are different and if residual oil is

when deck conditions are observed from the topside only  when sour crude is stored  all openings on the tanks should be kept closed because hydrogen sulfide is poisonous  this can be accomplished by equipping the tanks with some type of ground level gauging and by locating thermometers in the tank shell  gauges and temperatures then can be read from the ground without the tank being opened  these gauging devices usually require approval by the crude purchaser  grounding level sampling also can be accomplished by installing pipes that extend into the tank at any desired level and to any desired distance  valves are located at a convenient level to permit sampling on the ground without the tanks being opened  if available  a small amount of sweet gas should be fed into the top of the tank continuously to establish a  quot gas sweep  quot  this ensures positive pressure within the tank at all times and prohibits air from entering the tank  thereby greatly reducing corrosion  it is advisable to extend the tank vent line well beyond the tank battery and to use a back pressure valve and flame arrester in the vent line  the vapors should be flared and not vented      maintenance     storage tanks that are properly designed  constructed  and maintained can provide    to    years of service   steel tanks should be kept clean and free from spilled oil or other material  they should be kept painted and all water or accumulated dirt should be removed from around the bottom edge of the tanks  thief

measurements that are concerned with the geometry and integrity of the wellbore  acoustic and electrical imaging of the geological architecture and fabric of the rock system penetrated by the well  and downhole measurements that use the earth   s gravitational and magnetic fields to infer large scale changes through density and magnetization  respectively  although some of these technologies are applied beyond the petroleum industry  e g   geotechnical studies and hydrogeology   this overview concentrates on their hydrocarbon applications  each topic has a brief introduction  a description of the principles of each method  a discussion of its practical application  and  in selected cases  an illustrative case history     fig   g      summarizes how these specialized logging methods relate to reservoir characteristics and the techniques for measuring them  as presented in chaps   b through  f and chap    in this section and chap     in the drilling engineering section of this   handbook    file vol  page      image      png    fig   g       this chart is separated into three concentric areas  the middle annular area indicates the subsurface properties to be evaluated  the innermost area indicates the specialized logging tools discussed here  and the outermost area indicates the logging tools discussed in other subchapters of this   handbook    the corresponding innermost and outermost areas show how the different tools complement each other in the investigation of particular subsurface properties     __toc__     geometry and integrity of the wellbore         directional surveys           principles       with the growth in drilling deviated  extended reach  and horizontal wells  the location of the wellbore is increasingly a  d problem  it is encountered in one of two situations  to direct and define the trajectory of the well during the drilling process  geosteering  or to characterize the well path after drilling  the former has contributed to huge increases in well productivity  the latter is a vital element of integrated reservoir studies in which the aim is to generate a  d model of the reservoir based on correct well locations  this discussion is set within the context of the latter  geosteering is a benefit of logging while drilling technology  see chap     in the drilling engineering section of this   handbook    in directional survey terminology  the azimuth is the orientation of the wellbore to  quot north  quot  which has been variously defined as magnetic north  geographic north  latitude and longitude   or grid north  e g   the universal transverse mercator  utm  geographic coordinate system   azimuth is typically measured clockwise from north  the inclination is the deviation of the wellbore from the vertical  the azimuth and inclination define the coordinates of the wellbore along its length  usually relative to the location of the wellhead  tool face quantifies the direction in which the tool is pointing  it is the angle between a reference direction on a downhole tool and a fixed reference in space  for near vertical wells  the fixed reference is magnetic north and the  magnetic  tool face is the angle between magnetic north and the projection of the tool   s reference direction onto a horizontal plane  for more deviated wells  the fixed reference is the top of the hole and the  gravity or high side  tool face is the tool orientation with respect to the top of the hole  directional surveys allow azimuth and inclination to be determined so that the coordinates of well location can be computed at each survey station      measurement       there are two types of directional surveys  magnetic and gyroscope surveys  traditionally  each of these has been run using either single  or multishot tools  the tools are self contained and can be powered from the surface or with downhole batteries  for a detailed description  see bourgoyne   et al   bourgoyne  a t   millheim  k k   chenevert   m e  et al        applied drilling engineering     richardson  texas  textbook series  spe magnetic surveys can be run on the drillstring while tripping or on a wireline  conducting cable  after drilling  they are openhole measurements  in the simplest form  a magnetic survey tool comprises a downhole inclinometer and a compass unit  more advanced tools comprise arrays of three axis accelerometers  inclinometers  and magnetometers  a three axis accelerometer measures three orthogonal components of gravity  which combine vectorially to give the direction of the earth   s gravitational field relative to the axis of the tool and a reference position on its circumference  a three axis magnetometer measures the direction of the earth   s magnetic field relative to the tool axis  as    fig   g      illustrates  by combining the accelerometer and magnetometer data  it is possible to calculate the inclination

bops  chokes  choke manifolds  and  in some cases  atmospheric degasser units  however  the equipment may not be satisfactory for a particular well  in addition  some land rigs currently operate with well control equipment that is not state of the art  such as positive chokes  manual chokes  and manifold systems that do not have centrally located drillpipe  and casing pressure gauges    bop rental is expensive  high pressure stacks range from u s         to        day  exclusive of chokes or manifolds  the operator must define the worst pressure case that can feasibly be attained and select preventers accordingly  cost estimates for a complete stack must consider the spherical  multiple ram sets  spools  studs  ring gaskets  and outlet valves    remotely controlled  hydraulic adjustable chokes are considered state of the art and are available from several sources  contractors seldom furnish this type of choke primarily because operators have always assumed this cost responsibility  these chokes usually cost u s      to      day with a    day minimum charge  choke manifolds must be designed to withstand the maximum pressure ratings in addition to coinciding with current company philosophy      rotary tools and accessories   rotary tools are items related to the drillstring or equipment that turns the string  the operator may be required to furnish     support equipment for the contractor   s drillpi  or     a completely different string  if the contractor   s drillpipe does not meet the requirements  i e   tapered or work strings    some of the items that may require

of the tool joints and collars on the casing  a smaller pipe  and collar size combination would be recommended  if the       in  pipe were a drilling liner  a tapered string would be satisfactory  but an extra bop might be required    a work string consists of small diameter drillpipe and collars  it is used generally during completions or workover operations  because the pipe will be used inside production casing  the usual sizes are       to     in  most operations require a rental string because few rigs drill with this size pipe     mud related equipment    a properly maintained mud system offers many benefits to the operator  to achieve the desired level of system efficiency  several specialized pieces of equipment may be required  some of the equipment must be rented  even though the drilling rig may be well equipped with other drilling tools    a complete suite of equipment required for the mud job usually depends on the mud type and weight  the following suite may be used for mud weights in the       to      lbm gal range      multiscreen shaker      desilter  with pumps       mud gas separator      degasser  vacuum       pit flow monitors      drill rate recorder      gas

prior to dumping      casing tools    recently  great strides have been made in running casing  specialized equipment and crews normally handle the task rather than using the rig crew and equipment  because most rigs are not furnished with casing running equipment  it must be rented    casing tools must be selected according to size and loading requirements  a commonly used method for evaluating

no circumstance should a modu be designed or rated for environmental conditions in which waves will come in contact with the upper hull  in addition  heave  roll  pitch  sway  yaw  and surge need to be analyzed in terms of the upper limits of motion in which crews and equipment can operate   for example  significant amounts of heave  if slow  long periods   may be tolerable for most operations  however  short heaves that are very fast  very short periods  are more difficult  from a crew performance standpoint  smooth predictable motions generally do not hinder performance  however  jerky unpredictable motion will have a significant negative impact  metocean conditions throughout the world result in most semis being operated in less than    to    second wave or swell periods  so

solid wax crystals will result in diffusion like transport of these particles when a concentration gradient exists  this effect is normally neglected in pipeline deposition models  gravity settling can occur because precipitated wax crystals are denser than the surrounding liquid  again  this effect is usually neglected in flow models  molecular diffusion and shear dispersion are described below

the pipe wall  there will be a temperature gradient across this sublayer with the lower temperature at the pipe wall  when the temperature is below the wat  the flowing oil will contain precipitated solid wax  which is in equilibrium with the liquid  because the temperature is colder toward the wall  more of the wax components will exist in the solid phase at equilibrium  this results in a

fluid in the laminar flow regime  they tend to travel with the mean speed and direction of the fluid  particles have higher velocities at greater distances from the pipe wall  and the particles also rotate as they flow  these rotating particles will exert drag forces  causing displacement of the flow paths of any neighboring particles  when the particle concentration is high  these interactions result in net transport of particles toward the low velocity region at the pipe wall   considering all the wax forming components together as a single wax pseudocomponent  the rate of mass transport

produce formation sand or fines with fluids  these formations are usually geologically young  tertiary age  and shallow  and they have little or no natural cementation  sand production is unwanted because it can plug wells  erode equipment  and reduce well productivity  it also has no economic value  nonetheless  formation sand production from wells is dealt with daily on a global basis  in certain producing regions  sand control completions are the dominant type and result in considerable added expense to operations      fluid flow     fluid flow from wells is the consequence of the wellbore pressure being smaller than that in the reservoir  the drag force caused by the flow from large to small pressure is related to the velocity viscosity product at any point around the well  hence  when fluids flow toward the wellbore  the tendency is for some of the formation material to flow concurrently with the fluids penberthy  w l  jr  and shaughnessy  c m        sand control  vol

by intergranular cementation that is a secondary geologic process  as a general rule  old sediments are more consolidated than are younger sediments  young formations commonly have little cementing material and are referred to as being poorly consolidated  stated another way  they have low compressive strength  their compressive strengths are usually less than       psi and may even be so small that their strengths can not be measured  the frictional forces are related to the confining or overburden stresses  the stress that causes the rock to fail includes the mechanical stress that results from the overburden and the drag forces associated from viscous flow of fluids through the rock matrix  the overburden stress is partially supported by the pore pressure  so the net stress  the cause of rock failure  the effective stress  is the difference between the overburden stress and the pore pressure   capillary forces can also contribute to sand production  there are numerous examples where sand production occurred when water production began  sand arches form  on occasion  around the perforations  the questions of when and how arches form are related to    flow rate  compressive

consequences of sand production     the consequences of sand production are always detrimental to the short long term productivity of the well  although some wells routinely experience manageable sand

accumulation downhole      if the production velocity in well tubulars is insufficient to transport sand to the surface  it will begin to fill the inside of the casing  eventually  the producing interval may be completely covered with sand  in this case  the production rate will decline until the well becomes    sanded up    and production ceases  in situations like this  remedial operations are required to clean out the well and restore productivity  one cleanout technique is to run a    bailer    on a wireline to remove the sand from the production tubing or casing  because the bailer removes only a small volume of sand at a time  multiple wireline runs are necessary to clean out the well  another cleanout operation involves running a smaller diameter tubing string or coiled tubing down into the production tubing to agitate the sand and lift it out of the well by circulating fluid  the inner string is progressively lowered while circulating the sand out of the well  this operation must be performed cautiously to avoid the possibility of sticking the inner string inside the production tubing  if the production of sand is continuous  the cleanout operations may be required periodically  as often as monthly or even weekly  resulting in lost production and increased well maintenance costs       accumulation in surface equipment      if the production velocity is sufficient to transport sand to the surface  the sand may still become trapped in the separator  heater treater  or production fl

a result  extensive research has been applied to describe and understand the permeability of rocks to fluid flow  in this chapter  only single phase or absolute permeability will be considered  multiphase relative permeabilities must be derived using relations described in the chapter on relative permeability and capillary pressure permeability    k    is a rock property relating the flow per unit area to the hydraulic gradient by darcy   s law rtenotitle                          where   p   is pressure         is fluid density    g   is gravitational acceleration    z   is elevation  and        is the dynamic viscosity  the ratio   q     a   has the units of velocity and is sometimes referred to as the  quot darcy velocity quot  to distinguish it from the localized velocity of flow within pore channels  the natural unit of   k   is length squared  however  petroleum usage casts    eq          in mixed units  so that the unit of   k   is the darcy  which is defined as the

richardson  texas  society of petroleum engineers  noted that darcy   s law holds only for viscous flow and that the medium must be      saturated with the flowing fluid when the determination of permeability is made  furthermore  the medium and the fluid must not react by chemical reaction  absorption  or adsorption  otherwise  the permeability changes as the fluid flows through the sample  darcy   s law     eq           has many practical applications  including determination of permeability in the laboratory and wellbore in hydrological applications  the fluid is assumed to be water at near surface conditions  the viscosity of water is factored into the transport term  which is called hydraulic conductivity    k    and has the units of velocity  darcy   s law is then written asrtenotitle                          this version of darcy   s law is not useful to the petroleum engineer  but it is sometimes handy to be able to convert from hydraulic conductivity units to permeability  to obtain   k   in darcies  multiply   k   in m s by           permeability is a property of pore space geometry  specifically  it has been found to be proportional to    r        where   r   is a pore throat dimension and        is porosity  however  a measure of   r   is not available unless capillary pressure determinations have been made  in which case permeability has also been determined in the laboratory  because permeability can be measured only on a restricted set of samples or from a limited number of well tests  it must often be derived from other properties or measurements  porosity and permeability are routinely measured on core plugs  for this reason  the systematics of permeability and porosity are reviewed in this chapter the topics of fluid sensitivity and stress also deserve consideration  many rocks contain clays or other minerals that are sensitive to the pore fluid  if an incompatible pore fluid is introduced during a production process  these minerals can change form  swell  or migrate  permeability can then decrease by orders of magnitude  as effective pressure is increased  pore space decreases and permeability is lowered  the change in permeability with pressure is greater at low effective pressures  this pressure dependence is also strong in poorly consolidated rocks or rocks where flow is dominated by fractures  as rocks become consolidated or well cemented  the pressure dependence may become negligible finally  the problem of quantitatively predicting permeability from porosity and other measurements that can be made with well logs is examined  to predict permeability  one needs a physical model and a method of zoning or clustering the data  models used to predict permeability from porosity and other measurable rock parameters fall into classes based on grain size  mineralogy  surface area  or pore dimension parameters  zonation techniques include database  statistical  clustering  and neural network approaches  ultimately  the choices of model and zonation method depend on the problem at hand  the data available  and the resources devoted to the task __toc__     petrologic controls     permeability values of

calculations  and summary and conclusions  this chapter concerns the foot by foot calculations of the five petrophysical parameters at the wellbore  it does not cover the propagation of the wellbore values  or  quot populating quot  of static or dynamic reservoir models  vertically and areally over the whole of the reservoir volume  because other chapters in this section of the amp nbsp   handbook   amp nbsp discuss the technical details of various well logs and coring  these details are generally assumed as the basis for this chapter and are referenced accordingly in practical terms  petrophysics is used for two types of calculations  determination of original hydrocarbons in place  original oil in place  ooip  or original gas in place  ogip   and their distribution  and reservoir engineering dynamic flow calculations  for the development geoscientists  geologists  geophysicists  and geostatisticians   petrophysics means developing the detailed stratigraphic  depositional  and

net pay  porosity  water saturation  and permeability are necessary  these calculations need to be made not only as overall calculations  but also so that the variation and distribution of these parameters are determined appropriately some of the petrophysical calculations can be made in several ways  particularly for porosity and water saturation  one key to arriving at an accurate petrophysical calculation is to obtain the same quantitative result with a variety of techniques  an important consideration is the acquisition and handling of the various types of petrophysical data and  for each reservoir  the preparation of its unique petrophysical database  petrophysical data take many forms and  for many reservoirs  may not be as comprehensive as desired  the technical personnel working with these data have to review what data are available  their quality  and what additional data might be acquired from the existing wellbores and from preserved and unpreserved cores  finally  if there are sufficient financial stakes  new wells might be drilled  cores cut  various additional sample measurements made  and both conventional and special logs run to obtain other desired petrophysical information as mentioned previously  this chapter does not deal with log analysis  the petrophysical evaluations made when no core  mud log  or tester data are available  log

positive   depending on the relative salinities of the formation water and the mud filtrate  if the formation water salinity is greater than the mud filtrate salinity  the more common case   the deflection is to the left   the relevant features of the sp curve are its shape and the size of its departure from the shale baseline  because the absolute reading and position of the shale baseline on the log are irrelevant  the sp sensitivity scale and shale baseline position are selected by the logging engineer for convenience  the sp log is typically scaled at     mv per log track  if the resistivities of the mud filtrate and formation water are similar  the sp deflections are small and the curve is rather featureless  an sp curve cannot be recorded in holes filled with nonconductive

accompanying electronics  they have been designed to measure one or more acoustic wave properties to obtain data about subsurface formations  this article focuses on the varied types of acoustic logging tools and how they collect data      overview     acoustic sources  transmitters  generally consist of piezoelectric transducers that generate the acoustic signal by converting electrical signals into a sonic vibration that travels through the borehole and adjacent rock formations  monopole  axisymmetric  transducers generate omnidirectional acoustic waves around the tool circumference  while dipole  nonaxisymmetric  transducers generate azimuthally oriented acoustic waves     fig           file vol  page      image      png    fig        direction of particle motion in compressional and shear waves and wave motion generated by monopole and dipole transmitters  courtesy of baker atlas        modern receivers are piezoelectric crystals that transform the received  measured  acoustic signal back into electrical signals  different logging tools use different piezoelectric materials and operate at different frequencies to measure different energy modes  wave types   the pressure variation produced by an acoustic wave displaces the piezoelectric material causing it to ring or oscillate  when the receiver oscillates  it develops a small voltage  this voltage is amplified and the raw data are processed downhole and sent to the surface acquisition system in the form of a    waveform signal  wireline   acoustic slowness  wireline and logging while drilling  lwd    digital data are stored  either at the surface  wireline  or downhole  lwd   for wellsite log presentations and post acquisition processing and playback   the energy  amplitude  of acoustic waves is lost  attenuated or dispersed  primarily by travel through the borehole fluid and rock matrix  additional attenuation may result from a number of other factors that include    internal particle friction within the propagation medium  changes in acoustic impedance  the product of density          and acoustic velocity    v     at interfaces  boundaries  between different mediums  borehole rugosity  signal cancellation resulting from tool eccentering  in general  the largest signal possible occurs when the instrument is in the center of the hole  a dipole tool in an extremely large borehole may be exception to this rule  for high frequencies  the monopole signal is reduced by as much     of the centralized value by displacing the instrument only inches from the center of the hole  consequently  whenever possible  centralizers should be used with acoustic logging tools      critical spacing     the acoustic wave travels through the formation much faster than it does through the borehole fluid and reaches the receiver by the longer formation route first  this is true as long as the critical spacing is less than actual spacing  critical spacing is the transmitter to receiver spacing at which the fluid signal and formation signal arrive at the receiver at the same time  the critical spacing value depends on    diameter of the logging sonde  diameter of the borehole  time of travel through the fluid  time of travel through the rock  in soft formations  and under certain conditions  the critical spacing can exceed actual spacing and the fluid arrival  which exists for a noncentralized tool  can interfere with the acoustic signal  when this occurs  data processing methods can exclude this fluid arrival  thereby reducing or possibly eliminating interference from the fluid arrival  longer transmitter receiver spacings are used to minimize this occurrence   the transmitter to receiver spacing in modern monopole tools is set to enable separation of the compressional  and shear energy packets to allow for accurate measurement of both in fast formations  when logging with an array acoustic device  the receivers nearest the

ideal gas is useful for understanding gas behavior and simplifying the calculation of gas properties  this page describes an ideal gas  and develops the ideal gas law and the gas law constant      ideal gas     the kinetic theory of gases postulates that a gas is composed of a large number of very small discrete particles  these particles can be shown to be identified with molecules  for an ideal gas  the volume of these particles is assumed to be so small that it is negligible compared with the total volume occupied by the gas  it is assumed also that these particles or molecules have neither attractive nor repulsive forces between them  the average energy of the particles or molecules can be shown to be a function of temperature only  thus  the kinetic energy    e    k    is independent of molecule type or size  because kinetic energy is related to mass and velocity by   e    k           mv     it follows that small molecules  less mass  must travel faster than large molecules  more mass  when both are at the same temperature      boyle s law and charles  law     molecules are considered to be moving in all directions in a random manner as a result of frequent collisions with one another and with the walls of the containing vessel  the collisions with the walls create the pressure exerted by the gas  thus  as the volume occupied by the gas is decreased  the collisions of the particles with the walls are more frequent  and an increase in pressure results  it is a statement of boyle   s law that this increase in pressure is inversely proportional to the change in volume at constant temperature   rtenotitle                         where      p   is the absolute pressure    v   is the volume   further  if the temperature is increased  the velocity of the molecules and  therefore  the energy with which they strike the walls of the containing vessel will be increased  resulting in a rise in pressure  to maintain the pressure constant while heating a gas  the volume must be increased in proportion to the change in absolute temperature  this is a statement of charles    law   rtenotitle                         where      t   is the absolute temperature    p   is a constant  from a historical viewpoint  the observations of boyle and charles in no small degree led to the establishment of the kinetic theory of gases  rather than vice versa  it follows from this discussion that  at zero degrees absolute  the kinetic energy of an ideal gas  as well as its volume and pressure  would be zero  this agrees with the definition of absolute zero  which is the temperature at which all the molecules present have zero kinetic energy   because the kinetic energy of a molecule depends only on temperature  and not on size or type of molecule  equal molecular quantities of different gases at the same pressure and temperature would occupy equal volumes  the volume occupied by an ideal gas therefore depends on three things  temperature  pressure  and number of molecules  moles  present  it does not depend on the type of molecule present      ideal gas law     the ideal gas law  which is actually a combination of boyle   s and charles    laws

uses an external source of high pressure gas for supplementing formation gas to lift the well fluids  there are two basic types of gas lift in use today   continuous and intermittent flow    continuous flow gas lift     the vast majority of gas lift wells are produced by continuous flow  which is very similar to natural flow  in continuous flow gas lift  the formation gas is supplemented with additional high pressure gas from an outside source  gas is injected continuously into the production conduit at a maximum depth that depends upon the injection gas pressure and well depth  the injection gas mixes with the produced well fluid and decreases the density and  subsequently  the flowing pressure gradient of the mixture from the point of gas injection to the surface  the decreased flowing pressure gradient reduces the flowing bottomhole pressure below the static bottomhole pressure thereby creating a pressure differential that allows the fluid to flow into the wellbore     fig          illustrates this principal  file vol  page     image      png    fig       flowing pressure gradient traverses above and below the depth of gas injection in a continuous flow gas lift well        intermittent flow gas lift     as the name implies  intermittent flow is the periodic displacement of liquid from the tubing by the injection of high pressure gas  the action is similar to that observed when a bullet is fired from a gun      see fig            the liquid slug that has accumulated in the tubing represents the bullet  when the trigger is pulled  gas lift valve opens   high pressure injection gas enters the chamber  tubing  and rapidly expands  this action forces the liquid slug  shaded in    fig           from the tubing in the same way that expanding gas forces the bullet from the gun  the disadvantage of intermittent flow gas lift is the  quot on off quot  need for high pressure gas  which presents a gas handling problem at the surface and causes surging in the flowing bottomhole pressure that cannot be tolerated in many wells producing sand  because of the intermittent production of the well  intermittent flow gas lift is not capable of producing at as high a rate as continuous flow gas lift  intermittent flow should not be considered unless the flowing bottomhole pressure is low  and the well is gas lifting from the bottom valve  file vol  page     image      png    fig       injection gas cycle for gas lifting a liquid slug in an intermittent gas lift well          applications       gas lift is particularly applicable for lifting fluids in wells that have a significant amount of gas produced with the crude  gas compressors are nearly always installed to gather the produced gas and  with only minor changes  can be designed to supply the high injection gas pressure for the gas lift system  the injected gas only supplements the formation gas and may amount to only a small percentage of the total produced gas volume  most continuous flow wells can be depleted by gas lift because reservoir pressure maintenance programs are implemented in most major oil fields and many reservoirs have waterdrives      advantages of gas lift       the flexibility of gas lift  in terms of production rates and depth of lift  can seldom be matched by other methods of artificial lift if adequate injection gas pressure and volume are available  gas lift is one of the most forgiving forms of artificial lift because a poorly designed installation will normally gas lift some fluid  the mandrel depths for many gas lift installations with retrievable valve mandrels are calculated with minimal well information highly deviated wells that produce sand and have high formation gas liquid ratios are excellent candidates for gas lift when artificial lift is needed  many gas lift installations are designed to increase the daily production from flowing wells  no other method is as ideally suited for through flowline ocean floor completions as a gas lift system  wireline retrievable gas lift valves can be replaced without killing a well or pulling the tubing the gas lift valve is a simple device with few moving parts  and sand laden well fluids do not have to pass through the valve to be lifted  the individual well downhole equipment is relatively inexpensive  the surface equipment for injection gas control is simple and requires little maintenance and practically no space for installation  typically  the reported high overall reliability and lower operating costs for a gas lift system are superior to other methods of lift      limitations of gas lift       the primary limitation for gas lift operations is the lack of formation gas or an injection gas source  wide well spacing and lack of space for compressors on offshore platforms may also limit the application of gas lift  poor compressor maintenance can increase compressor downtime and

sources identified in separate articles  see see also section below   other  less common causes include emulsions and sludges  wettability alteration  bacterial plugging  gas breakout  and water blocks      emulsions and sludges     the presence of emulsions at the surface does not imply the formation of emulsions in the near wellbore region  most often  surface emulsions are a result of mixing and shearing that occur in chokes and valves in the flow stream after the fluids have entered the well  it is uncommon to have emulsions and sludges form in the near wellbore region without the introduction of external chemicals schechter  r s        oil well stimulation  englewood cliffs  new jersey  prentice hall the mixing of two immiscible fluids at a high shear rate in the formation can sometimes result in the formation of a homogeneous mixture of one phase dispersed into another  such emulsions usually have a higher viscosity than either of the constituent fluids and can result in significant decreases in the ability of the hydrocarbon phase to flow   crude oil brine emulsions are stabilized by the presence of surfactants and colloidal particles such as clays  paraffins  and asphaltenes  in general  organophilic particles such as paraffins and asphaltenes favor the formation of oil external emulsions and sludges  water wet solids such as clays favor the formation of water external emulsions  it is important to minimize the loss of surface active materials into the near wellbore region to ensure that emulsions do not form  for example  large volumes of surfactants are used as corrosion inhibitors and dispersants in acid treatments  a significant cause of failure of acid treatments is the formation of sludges and emulsions during an acid treatment as a result of the presence of these surfactants  the compatibility of crude oil with the acid package needs to be evaluated before it is pumped into the well  it has also been observed that the presence of iron enhances the formation of these sludges  it is therefore recommended that iron be removed from the tubing by circulating a slug of acid to the surface to ensure that the iron rich acid is not squeezed into the formation during an acid treatment   in general  it is difficult to remove emulsions and sludges once they are formed  thus  it is imperative to prevent the formation of such emulsions  use of mutual solvents such as alcohols and surfactants  demulsifiers  is the most common way to remove these deposits from the near wellbore region  however  because of the unfavorable mobility ratio of the injected fluid  placing the treatment fluids in the plugged zones can be difficult  again  laboratory tests with the crudes should be conducted to ensure compatibility      wettability alteration

region around the wellbore can result in an additional pressure drop because of the reduction in oil permeability  this additional pressure drop or skin is hard to distinguish from mechanical skin caused by physical plugging of pore throats  in effect  wettability alteration has the same net result as changing the effective permeability to the hydrocarbon phase in a region around the wellbore

recovery from individual wells tends to be controlled by a number of factors  including the gross thickness of the oil column and the horizontal vertical permeability ratio in the well   s drainage area  this ratio might vary significantly over the areal extent of the reservoir  depending on the depositional environment of the reservoir rock  experience with such reservoirs indicates that this

specific gravity of          even moderate volumes of sand can substantially increase the pressure gradient of the fluid column in the production tubing      overview     sand production is frequently a byproduct of oil production  especially in some primary heavy oil operations  e g   canada  where it is an important part of the recovery process  in such operations  sand influx is usually most severe during the initial stage of production when the volumetric sand cuts can exceed      subsequently  the sand cuts often stabilize at         in high rate applications  e g   venezuela   even low sand cuts can equate to significant volumes of produced sand over time      handling sand production     with proper system design and operation  progressing cavity pump  pcp  systems can effectively handle produced fluids with significant sand cuts under reasonably steady state conditions  severe operational problems  equipment failures  shutdowns requiring workovers  generally develop due to short periods of rapid sand influx  slugging   although some slugging occurs naturally  sudden sand influx can also be initiated by operating practices that cause fairly rapid changes in bottomhole pressure  the pressure variations affect inflow rates and can disturb stable sand bridges that develop around perforations  causing the bridges to collapse and sand to flow into the wellbore  for example  experience has shown that large changes in pump speed can precipitate sand slugging  therefore  large adjustments in pump speed should be made gradually over a few days to allow the well time to stabilize  if possible  other practices that produce sudden variations in bottomhole pressure  such as well loading or casing gas blowdown  should also be avoided  workover operations that cause swabbing of a well  e g   rapid pulling of the production tubing string within the perforated interval  are often followed by periods of high sand production  changes in the produced fluid conditions can also precipitate sand influx  for example  a sudden increase in water production or a slug of higher viscosity fluid can lead to a breakdown of stable sand arches  causing a slug of sand to enter the wellbore       handling sand accumulation in the tubing      sand accumulation inside the tubing just above the pump is a common problem  it leads to increased pump discharge pressures  reduced fluid rates  and in severe cases  increased potential for sudden pump failure  sand buildup occurs when the produced fluid stream cannot carry all the sand up the tubing to surface  therefore  it is very important to assess the sand handling capabilities of a pcp system design for applications in which sand production is expected  sand settling and fluid transport velocities  in vertical pipes  can be assessed by comparing the fluid drag forces calculated using well established methodsgovier  g w  and aziz  k        the flow of complex mixtures in pipes  second edition  richardson  texas  society of petroleum engineers  with the weight of the sand particles or particle conglomerates as appropriate       handling sand build up in the pump intake region      sand buildup in the pump intake area causes decreased production rates and  in severe cases  pump failure due to complete blockage of the intake  one effective way to minimize sand accumulation around the intake is to provide a sump below the pump where excess sand can settle  deeper sumps provide a larger buffer  and therefore it will take longer before sand accumulates to the pump level  certain pump intake designs also contribute to sanding problems  restricted intakes tend to produce stagnant flow regions where the sand will settle out  for sandy applications  the pump intake should be configured so that fluids can readily flow  i e   limited bends  channels  from the wellbore into the pump intake       dealing with operational issues caused by sand production      operational problems associated with sand settlement and bridging  both above and below the pump  occur most commonly in directional and horizontal wells  the ability of the produced fluid to transport sand improves with increasing fluid viscosity and flow velocity  initial system design should consider whether the lowest anticipated production rate will be capable of moving the sand up the tubing  and allowances should be made for slugs of sand entering the system  decreasing the tubing size and increasing the flow rate are the easiest ways to improve sand transport capability  however  the use of smaller diameter tubing must be evaluated in terms of its effect on flow losses  injecting a fluid down the annulus and pumping at higher ra

fracture treated to produce economic volumes of gas at economic flow rates  in this page  we will discuss a few basic considerations for fracture treatment design and application      formation mechanical properties     many tight gas reservoirs are thick  layered systems that must be hydraulically fracture treated to produce at commercial gas flow rates  to optimize the completion  it is necessary to understand the mechanical properties of all the layers above  within  and below the gas pay intervals  basic rock properties such as in situ stress  young   s modulus and poisson   s ratio are needed to design a fracture treatment  the in situ stress of each rock layer affects how much pressure is required to create and propagate a fracture within the layer  the values of young   s modulus relate to the stiffness of the rock and help determine the width of the hydraulic fracture  the values of poisson   s ratio relate to the lateral deformation of the rock when stressed  poisson   s ratio is a parameter required in several fracture design formulas  the definition of these mechanical properties  the importance of these parameters  and how to determine values for each property are discussed in hydraulic fracturing  the most important mechanical property is in situ stress  often called the minimum compressive stress or the fracture closure pressure  when the pressure inside the fracture is greater than the in situ stress  the fracture is open  when the pressure inside the fracture is less than the in situ stress  the fracture is closed  we can determine values of in situ stress using logs  cores  or injection tests  to optimize the completion  it is very important to know the values of in situ stress in every rock layer       candidate selection      the success or failure of a hydraulic fracture treatment often depends on the quality of the candidate well selected for the treatment  choosing an excellent candidate for stimulation often ensures success  while choosing a poor candidate normally results in economic failure  to select the best candidate for stimulation  the design engineer must consider many variables  the most critical parameters for hydraulic fracturing are formation permeability  the in situ stress distribution  reservoir fluid viscosity  skin factor  reservoir pressure  reservoir depth  and the condition of the wellbore  the skin factor refers to whether the reservoir is already stimulated or  perhaps  damaged  if the skin factor is positive  the reservoir is damaged and will likely be an excellent candidate for stimulation   the best candidate wells for hydraulic fracturing treatments in a tight gas reservoir have a substantial volume of ogip and good barriers to vertical fracture growth above and below the net pay intervals  such reservoirs have    a thick pay zone  medium to high pressure  in situ stress barriers to minimize vertical height growth  substantial areal extent  tight gas reservoirs that are not good candidates for hydraulic fracturing are those with    a small volume of gas in place because of thin reservoirs  low reservoir pressure  small areal extent  also  reservoirs that do not have enough clean shale above or below the pay interval to suppress vertical fracture growth are considered to be poor candidates  reservoirs with extremely low permeability might not produce enough hydrocarbons to pay all the drilling and completion costs  even if successfully stimulated  thus  such reservoirs would not be good candidates for stimulation       fracture treatment

following all affect how well downhole separation will work    separation equipment operating ranges  wellbore design  reservoir geology  the economics are often determined by the number of and locations of the wells and by the overall geographical development plan  it is important to recognize that downhole processing is not a substitute for prudent profile control of wells through workovers  gel polymer treatments  cement squeezes  and so on  the following discussion applies to both gas liquid and water oil processing  followed by sections that discuss screening criteria specific to each      overall considerations     from an equipment standpoint  gas liquid separation is much easier than oil water separation  this generally means that it is a more robust application  the same considerations relevant to surface separation apply   those evaluating the feasibility of a downhole process should consider    foaming tendency  emulsion formation  fluid density  viscosity  all separation and pump equipment has an expected lifetime that is typically much shorter than the lifetime of the well  the cost of replacing or repairing the equipment must be considered as well as the initial capital cost  some equipment can be placed through tubing by wireline or coiled tubing  which is usually most cost effective  replacing other equipment requires that the tubing be pulled by a rig  these workovers are relatively inexpensive onshore  more expensive in the shallow offshore  but can be very expensive for deepwater subsea wells  well completions originally designed for downhole processing work best  but a number of the systems can be retrofitted in existing wells   for downhole injection  a suitable injection zone is required  it must be hydraulically separate and have a high enough injectivity that the desired volumes can be injected  either with pumps compressors or by natural overpressure  the relative locations of these zones determine the required well completion and feasibility of downhole processing   many other factors are important when deciding to perform processing in a well vs  a centralized facility  centralized facilities tend to become more economical as the number of wells increases  the centralized facility may be a typical surface processing plant or a satellite processing facility  surface or subsea  that performs partial processing and sends the partially processed stream to a traditional facility for polishing  downhole processing is also favored when wellbore hydraulics limit production   the economics of downhole processing are driven also by the geographic location of the wells and the proximity of the individual wells to each other and to the processing facilities  downhole processing is more economical for remote wells  where transportation costs to facilities are high      gas liquid situations     gas may be separated in a number of ways  depending on well flow rate and completion design  for low rate wells  gravity separation in the wellbore can be achieved  with the liquids flowing to the tubing that extends below the perforations and the gas flowing up into the annulus  this is common for beam pumped wells and some electric submersible pump  esp  completions  standard stokes    law settling calculations  those used for surface separator design  can be performed to determine whether gravity separation is feasible for the gas and liquid production rates  the centrifugal gas separators upstream of electric submersible pumps  esps  provide a more active method of separating gas  and they work well when rates are too high for gravity separation and when esps are already planned for artificial lift  the auger separator is an alternative centrifugal separator with no moving parts  it performs a less complete separation than the esp rotating separators  typically removing    to     of the gas  vs  almost      for an esp separator   tubing and casing size are very important  these often determine whether the equipment can be placed through tubing or require that the tubing be pulled by a workover rig  these tubular sizes also determine the maximum separator and pump equipment diameters  diameter restrictions may dictate that several stages of esps and hydrocyclones are required for the expected production rate   an economic comparison of various downhole gas water

the same as the standard gross gamma ray count log  gamma rays from the formation are counted in a detector system  however  there is an added level of sophistication  the energy of the gamma ray captured by the detector is proportional to the brightness of the light pulse it produces  and this brightness  in turn  determines the size of the electrical pulse produced by the photomultiplier  by sorting the pulses from the photomultiplier into bins by their size  a spectrum equivalent to the energy spectrum of the incoming gamma rays is produced  the energy of the gamma rays is determined by which element emitted them      identifying the spectrum     as we saw earlier  the energy of a gamma ray depends on its source  each of the standard naturally occurring radioactive elements  k  u  and th  gives off a gamma ray of a unique energy when it decays  potassium gives off only a gamma ray  the other elements give off a gamma ray  then decay to other elements called daughters  which  because they are still radioactive  give off other gamma rays  and so on  this gives rise to the pattern of gamma ray energies in    fig        these are called spectra of the elements and are as unique as fingerprints  it is not surprising that the brightness of a light pulse produced in a scintillator crystal is proportional to the energy of the gamma ray  the amount of current in the electrical pulse from the photomultiplier is in turn proportional to the brightness of the pulse of light  it is a simple matter to sort the pulses coming out of the photomultiplier into bins according to their pulse size before counting them  this is called pulse height spectrum analysis and gives rise to a histogram of count rates such as those in    fig      instead of a single count rate  common scintillators lack the resolution to break the gamma rays into fine enough bins to reproduce the spectra in    fig        so some sophisticated mathematical deconvolution is needed to infer proportions of uranium  potassium  and thorium from broadly windowed pulse height spectra    file vol  page      image      png    fig        the spectra of gamma rays emitted by the three naturally occurring radioactive measurements  mev  and  in the case of uranium and thorium  their daughters       there are several new things that can be done once we have k  u  and th count rates rather than just total gamma ray  the most important is that we can produce a count rate only because of potassium and thorium  this is very useful because these elements most often tag only clays  while uranium salts can be associated with moved water  these uranium salts can be precipitated out in porous reservoir rock  especially at the wellbore  where pressure changes may occur  this uranium can produce what appear to be hot sands on a gross gamma ray log  using the uranium free gamma ray curve from a spectral tool  cgr  in schlumberger   s mnemonics  can circumvent this problem and improve sand shale discrimination in such environments  occasionally  the ratio of thorium to potassium can be exploited in clay typing  the downside of spectral gamma ray curves is    reduced count rate  reduced precision  by dividing the spectra into three components  the count rate for any one component may be less than one third that of the total gamma ray measurement  further errors occur in the math of deconvolution  if high precision spectral gamma ray measurements are needed  reduced logging speed is required  the service companies have charts and computer programs that can help in the selection of logging speeds to achieve specific precisions      advantages of spectral gamma ray logs     spectral gamma ray measurements offer several advantages  they can help with clay typing  variations of the relative amounts of potassium  thorium  and uranium are associated with specific shale minerals  as is so often the case in log analysis  crossplots are used to highlight these differences  different clay minerals may  sometimes  array themselves in the pie slices of a thorium potassium crossplot  clays of different types also may plot in different regions on a crossplot of potassium or the thorium potassium ratio against   p    e    the pe factor  for the mathematically inclined  the same relationships may be captured in an equation of the form  rtenotitle                         for a typical shale  the coefficients are in the ratio of a b c        uranium is more often associated with fluid movement in porous rocks than shale minerals  at the very least  the effects of uranium can be removed  in other cases  potassium may be associated with feldspar rather than shale  differences in the ratios between the overlying reference shale and the shaly sands may highlight the problems with carrying clay properties from the overlying shale into the shaly sand interval      applications     spectral

techniques  compensation can be made in the gravel pack sand size selection  if necessary       produced samples      a produced sample of the formation sand is easily contaminated before it reaches the surface  although such a sample can be analyzed and used for the gravel pack sand size determination  produced samples will probably have a smaller median grain size than the median of actual formation sand  the well   s flow rate  produced fluid characteristics  and completion tubular design influence whether a particular size is produced to surface or settles to the bottom of the well  in many cases  the larger sand grains settle  so a sample that is produced to the surface has a higher proportion of the smaller size sand grains  this is the reason that the surface sample is not a good representation of the various sizes of formation sand  also  the transport of sand grains  through the production tubing and surface flow lines  may result in broken sand grains  causing the presence of more fine and smaller grains       bailed samples      samples collected from the bottom of a well using wireline bailers are also relatively easy to obtain  but these too are probably unrepresentative of the size of the actual formation sand  bailed samples are generally biased to the larger size sand grains  assuming that more of the smaller grains are produced to surface  bailed samples also may be misleading in terms of grain size distribution  when closing the well in to obtain a sample  the larger sand grains settle to the bottom of the well first  and the smaller sand grains fall on top of the larger ones  this results in a sorting of the formation sand grains into a sample that is not representative the formation sand  the use of bailed samples may result in the design of larger than required gravel pack sand that can result in sand production  small formation particles passing through the gravel pack  or plugging of the gravel pack  small formation particles filling the spaces between the gravel pack sand grains        sidewall core samples      sidewall core samples are obtained by shooting hollow projectiles from a gun lowered into the well on an electric line to the desired depth  the projectiles remain attached to the gun with steel cables  so that when the gun is pulled from the well  the projectiles are retrieved with a small formation sample inside  taking sidewall core samples is generally included in the evaluation stages of wells in unconsolidated formations  these are the most widely used sample types for gravel pack sand design  although more representative than produced or bailed samples  sidewall core samples can also give imprecise results because the volume in each sidewall sample is small  when the projectiles strike the face of the formation  localized crushing of the sand grains occurs  producing broken sand grains and generating more fine particles  the core sample also contains drilling mud solids that can be mistaken for formation material  experienced lab analysts can separate the effects of crushing and mud solids prior to evaluating the sample  thus improving the quality of the results       conventional core samples      the most representative formation sample is obtained from conventional cores  in the case of unconsolidated formations  rubber sleeve conventional cores may be required to assure sample recovery  although conventional cores are the most desirable formation sample  they are not readily available in many wells because of the cost of coring operations  coring in sand producing formations is also plagued with poor recovery  if available  small plugs can be taken under controlled circumstances at

pressure  bhp  on the formation to obtain a higher production rate from the well  this can be done with a positive displacement downhole pump  such as a beam pump or a progressive cavity pump  pcp   to lower the flowing pressure at the pump intake  it also can be done with a downhole centrifugal pump  which could be a part of an electrical submersible pump  esp  system  a lower bottomhole flowing pressure and higher flow rate can be achieved with gas lift in which the density of the fluid in the tubing is lowered and expanding gas helps to lift the fluids  artificial lift can be used to generate flow from a well in which no flow is occurring or used to increase the flow from a well to produce at a higher rate  most oil wells require artificial lift at some point in the life of the field  and many gas wells benefit from artificial lift to take liquids off the formation so gas can flow at a higher rate     to realize the maximum potential from developing any oil or gas field  the most economical artificial lift method must be selected  the methods historically used to select the lift method for a particular field vary broadly across the industry  the methods include operator experience  what methods are available for installations in certain areas of the world  what is working in adjoining or similar fields  determining what methods will lift at the desired rates and from the required depths  evaluating lists of advantages and disadvantages   quot expert quot  systems to both eliminate and select systems  and evaluation of initial costs  operating costs  production capabilities  etc  with the use of economics as a tool of selection  usually on a present value basis     these methods consider geographic location  capital cost  operating cost  production flexibility  reliability  and  quot mean time between failures  quot  this chapter discusses some of the most commonly used methods  in most cases  what has worked best or which lift method performs best in similar fields serve as selection criteria  also  the equipment and services available from vendors can easily determine which lift method will be applied  however  when significant costs for well servicing and high production rates are a part of the scenario  it becomes prudent for the operator to consider most  if not all  of the available evaluation and selection methods  if the  quot best quot  lift method is not selected  such factors as long term servicing costs  deferred production during workovers  and excessive energy costs  poor efficiency  can reduce drastically the net present value  npv  of the project  typically  the reserves need to be produced in a timely manner with reasonably low operating costs  conventional wisdom considers the best artificial lift method to be the system that provides the highest present value for the life of the project  good data are required for a complete present value analysis  and these data are not always broadly available     in some situations  the type of lift already has been determined and the task is to best apply that system to the particular well  the more basic question  however  is how to determine the proper type of artificial lift to apply in a given field for maximum present value profit  pvp   this chapter briefly reviews each of the major types of artificial lift before examining some of the selection techniques  some less familiar methods of lift also are mentioned  preliminary factors related to the reservoir and well conditions that should be considered are introduced     environmental and geographical considerations may be overriding issues  for example  sucker rod pumping is  by far  the most widely used artificial lift method in onshore united states operations  however  in a densely populated city or on an offshore platform with    wells in a very small deck area  sucker rod pumping might be a poor choice  also  deep wells producing several thousands of barrels per day cannot be lifted by beam lift  therefore  other methods must be considered  such geographic  environmental  and production considerations can limit the choices to only one method of lift  however  determining the best overall choice is more difficult when it is possible to apply several of the available lift methods     __toc__     reservoir pressure and well productivity      among the most important factors to consider when selecting an artificial lift system are current and future reservoir pressure and well productivity  if producing oil or liquid rate is plotted  x axis  against producing bhp

polymer concentrations in the     to         ppm range  but more commonly       to        ppm and most commonly       to        ppm   gels are often formulated with relatively inexpensive commodity polymers   gels have found broad application as oilfield fluid flow blocking agents because gels are often an exceptionally cost effective plugging and or permeability reducing agent for use in a number of different conformance improvement treatments  conformance improvement gels are  for the most part  essentially nothing but water  often produced brine  with the remainder of the gel constituents incorporated as low concentrations of relatively inexpensive polymers and chemical crosslinking agents      gel conformance improvement treatments     gels operate  for the most part  either by diverting fluid flow from high permeability  low oil saturation reservoir flow paths to low permeability  high oil saturation flow paths  and thereby promoting improved flood sweep efficiency and incremental oil production  or by reducing oil production operating costs by reducing excessive  deleterious  and competing coproduction of water or gas   oilfield gel conformance treatments can be applied in a number of forms including sweep improvement treatments  water shutoff treatments  gas shutoff treatments  zone abandonment treatments  squeeze and recompletion

increase well productivity  improve reservoir management  and access incremental reserves that could not be developed economically with vertical wells  while the first horizontal wells were drilled in competent formations  eventually soft formations were completed horizontally  leading to sand control needs  practically all horizontal wells drilled in soft formations have been completed openhole  most of these boreholes did not collapse  however  because many of these completions were in formations where conventional sand control applications were practiced  slotted liners and wire wrapped or prepacked screens were run to prevent hole collapse and sand production because horizontal gravel pack technology was not yet available      stand alone slotted liner and screen completions     the typical procedure for completing horizontal wells with slotted liners and screens includes the following steps    drill the well to the casing seat  set casing  drill the horizontal section  displace the hole  run the screen  produce the well  it is not always this simple  but the intent should be to follow these guidelines   sand control in horizontal wells was originally dealt with by using    stand alone slotted liners  screens  proprietary screens  more recently   the initial productivity of these completions was usually acceptable  and some were outstanding  however  in most applications  the stand alone devices either plugged or cut out  eroded  with time  the consequences are either unacceptably low well rates or excessive sand production  the acknowledged stand alone screen failure rate in the gulf of mexico was estimated to be about     in       since that time  numerous additional failures have occurred  and the failure rate has increased substantially  hence  in most applications  the use of stand alone screens as retention devices has been disappointing because the stand alone screen approach forces them to perform as filters  see    fig         their use in horizontal wells confirmed previous stand alone experience in vertical wells   they plugged    file vol  page     image      png    fig      screens and slotted liners without gravel packing  courtesy

inflow area proprietary screens  as might be expected  these completions experienced a wide range of reservoir situations  some stand alone applications have performed exceptionally well  the exceptional wells  mainly in the north sea  had formation permeabilities in the range of    to    darcy and were well sorted  experience in the gulf of mexico with stand alone screen completions has been disappointing  the failure rate from these completions has been well over     as of        in many horizontal wells where stand alone screens have been used  there are implications that the formation does not collapse around the screen  when this happens  there is an open annulus that serves as a conduit for fluid and particulate transport along the entire length of the screen  there are many examples in which a stand alone screen completion produced extremely well for a period of time and  then  abruptly lost productivity  the screens appear to be progressively plugging  however  because of the high flow capacity per foot of screen  a short section of unplugged screen can handle enormous flow rates  when the last few increments of screen plug  either production ceases or the screen erodes     fig   morales  r h   norman  w d   ali  s  et al        optimum fractures in high permeability formations  presented at the spe annual technical conference and exhibition  denver

developed to gravel pack horizontal wells because gravel packing can sustain productivity  gravel packing has always been the state of the art technology for vertical wells  gravel pack technology was not available for horizontal wells until       but its acceptance has been steadily increasing and is now the preferred technique  in this service  the screen functions as a gravel retention device  and the gravel placed around the screen fills and stabilizes the borehole  the streamlines into the screen are now normal because the annulus between the screen and the open hole is filled with gravel

types  design of the rod string  couplings  maintenance and replacement      steel sucker rods     api   spec    b  api spec    b  specification for sucker rods    th edition        washington  dc  api  provides the industry requirements for sucker rods and some related sucker rod lift equipment  the three main grades of steel rods follow    grade c rods that have minimum and maximum tensile strengths of        and         psi  respectively   grade k rods that have a minimum tensile strength of        psi and a maximum strength of         psi  these rods are made with      to       nickel and are  therefore  more expensive than grade c rods  but may have improved corrosion related properties   grade d rods that have a minimum tensile strength of         psi and a maximum strength of         psi  three types of this grade are covered by spec    b  plain carbon  alloy  and special alloy steels     spec    b   allows for rod lengths of    or    ft and pony rods in six lengths  i e                        and     in  measured from contact face of pin shoulder to contact face of pin shoulder   the acceptable rod diameter goes from     to       in  in     in  increments  the most common rods in use will meet api specifications and will probably be in    ft lengths  the most important selection requirement is that the pulling rig can accommodate single   double   or triple length rod segments   the api does not specify the minimum yield strength for sucker rods  where the yield strength of a rod string is necessary in calculations  it is recommended that if the manufacturer is not known  a minimum yield of        psi for grade c and k and of         psi for grade d should be used  if the manufacturer and rod type are known  the actual yield strength values should be used  for good operating practices  the minimum yield strength should not be exceeded   api   rp   br  api rp   br  recommended practice for care and handling of sucker rods  eighth edition  supplement    washington  dc  ansi api  provides industry recommendations on the selection and use of api grade rods       pony rods      pony rods are sucker rods shorter than    ft  and they vary in length  they are most commonly placed adjacent to the polished rod at the top of the rod string  on top of the downhole pump for handling purposes  and on top of the polished rod with appropriate couplings to prevent the string from falling downhole if the polished rod clamp slips  old pony rods normally should not be used in the load carrying part of a new rod strings  thus  when placing the rod string with new suckers  new pony rods should be used      fiber reinforced plastic sucker rods     fiber reinforced plastic  frp  sucker rods may be used instead of metal under certain conditions  these rods are normally made from protruded fiberglass  they also are standardized in size and performance by api   spec    b    reviewing this standard shows that temperature  load reversals  and fatigue life have a bigger effect on frp rods than on steel rods  it is important to keep the following in mind when screening a well for frp rod use    frp rod bodies will not corrode  but the rest of the steel components  including the fiberglass pin connectors and couplings  the steel rods making up the rest of the string  the pump  tubing  casing  flowlines  etc   still have to be protected if producing a corrosive fluid  thus  fiberglass rods should not be used alone to prevent rod string corrosion or system failures or to eliminate the need for an effective corrosion inhibition program   frp rods should be considered when the pumping unit gear reducer torque or structure rating exceed design limitation and need to be decreased  reducing the weight of the sucker rod string reduces the torque measured at the polished rod  however  if the well is expected to produce long term  it may be more cost effective to upsize the pumping unit   it should be determined if it will be possible to stroke the subsurface pump plunger because of the increased elasticity and effect on   sp      if the well deviation is very large at any point  the increased friction may cause buckling and compressive stresses on the sucker rods  increased buckling is very damaging to frp rods  thus  these probably should not be run in deviated wells   allowing fluid or gas pounding may produce damaging compressive forces in the frp rods  thus  maximum drawdown is not possible   currently  there is no recognized formula for calculating overtravel when a mixed frp and steel rod string is used  an

natural gas  many of the low permeability reservoirs that have been developed in the past are sandstone  but significant quantities of gas are also produced from low permeability carbonates  shales  and coal seams  production of gas from coal seams is covered in a separate chapter in this handbook  in this chapter  production of gas from tight sandstones is the predominant theme  however  much of the same technology applies to tight carbonate and to gas shale reservoirs   tight gas reservoirs have one thing in common   a vertical well drilled and completed in the tight gas reservoir must be successfully stimulated to produce at commercial gas flow rates and produce commercial gas volumes  normally  a large hydraulic fracture treatment is required to produce gas economically  in some naturally fractured tight gas reservoirs  horizontal wells and or multilateral wells can be used to provide the stimulation required for commerciality   to optimize the development of a tight gas reservoir  the geoscientists and engineers must optimize the number of wells drilled  as well as the drilling and completion procedures for each well  often  more data and more engineering manpower are required to understand and develop tight gas reservoirs than are required for higher permeability  conventional reservoirs  on an individual well basis  a well in a tight gas reservoir will produce less gas over a longer period of time than one expects from a well completed in a higher permeability  conventional reservoir  as such  many more wells  or smaller well spacing  must be drilled in a tight gas reservoir to recover a large percentage of the original gas in place  ogip   when compared to a conventional reservoir        definition of tight gas     in the     s  the united states government decided that the definition of a tight gas reservoir is one in which the expected value of permeability to gas flow would be less than     md  this definition was a political definition that has been used to determine which wells would receive federal and or state tax credits for producing gas from tight reservoirs  actually  the definition of a tight gas reservoir is a function of many factors  each relating to darcy   s law   the main problem with tight gas reservoirs is that they do not produce at economic flow rates unless they are stimulated   normally by a large hydraulic fracture treatment     eq       illustrates the main factors controlling flow rate     eq       clearly shows that the flow rate    q    is a function of permeability   k    net pay thickness   h    average reservoir pressure p    flowing pressure   pwf    fluid properties          drainage area   re    wellbore radius   rw    and skin factor   s    thus  to choose a single value of permeability to define  quot tight gas quot  is not wise  in deep  high pressure  thick reservoirs  excellent completions can be achieved when the formation permeability to gas is in the microdarcy range        md   in shallow  low pressure  thin reservoirs  permeabilities of several millidarcies  might be required to produce the gas at economic flow rates  even after a successful fracture treatment     rtenotitle                           the best way to define tight gas is that  quot the reservoir cannot be produced at economic flow rates nor recover economic volumes of natural gas unless a special technique is used to stimulate production  quot  specifically  large hydraulic fracture treatments  a horizontal wellbore  or multilateral wellbores must be used to stimulate flow rates and increase the recovery efficiency in the reservoir   so what is a typical tight gas reservoir  there are no  quot typical quot  tight gas reservoirs  they can be    deep or shallow  high pressure or low pressure  high temperature or low temperature  blanket or lenticular  homogeneous or naturally fractured  single layered or multilayered  the optimum drilling  completion and stimulation methods for each well are a function of the reservoir characteristics and the economic situation  some tight gas reservoirs are in south texas  while others are in the deserts of egypt  the costs to drill  complete and stimulate the wells  plus the gas price and the gas market affect how tight gas reservoirs are developed  as with all engineering problems  the technology used is a function of the economic conditions surrounding the project      resource triangle     the concept of the resource triangle was used by masters and grey to find a large gas field and build a company

applications  motors transform electrical energy into mechanical energy  an ac motor may be part of a pump  fan  or other form of mechanical equipment  ac motors are found in a variety of applications  from those that require a single motor to special applications that require several motors working in concert      overview     all ac motors are made up of a magnetic circuit formed by a stationary member called a stator and a rotating member known as rotor  the stator and rotor are separated by an air gap  the stator has primary windings that are connected to the power source and develop a rotating magnetic field  the rotor has secondary windings that rotate in the magnetic field created by the stator windings  this causes currents to flow in the secondary windings and causes development of a secondary magnetic field  how the rotors are designed and how the currents are made to flow determines the type of motor and its performance characteristics  two types of ac motors are widely used in the oil and gas industry  induction and synchronous      standards     the national electrical manufacturers association  nema  sets the standards for a wide range of electrical products  including motors  nema is associated primarily with motors used in north america  nema   s standards  see nema standard publication no  mg  _  represent general industry practices and are supported by manufacturers of electrical equipment  the nema standards might not apply to some large ac motors that are built to meet the requirements of a specific application  such motors are referred to as  quot above nema  quot  the american petroleum institute  api  and the institute of electrical and electronic engineers  ieee  also have standards for nema sized and above nema motors      rotor rotation         principle of rotation      to see how a rotor works  use a magnet mounted on a shaft in place of the squirrel cage rotor  as shown in the upper image in    fig        energizing the stator windings establishes a rotating magnetic field  the magnet has its own magnetic field that interacts with the rotating magnetic field of the stator  the north pole of the rotating magnetic field attracts the south pole of the magnet  and vice versa  as the rotating magnetic field rotates  it pulls the magnet along  causing it to rotate  motors that use this design are known as permanent magnet synchronous motors    file vol  page     image      png    fig      principle of motor rotation  courtesy of houston armature works inc         the squirrel cage rotor acts essentially the same as the magnet  when power is applied to the stator  current flows through the winding  causing an expanding electromagnetic field  emf  that cuts across the rotor bars   when a conductor  such as a rotor bar  passes through a magnetic field  it induces a voltage  an emf  in the conductor  the induced voltage causes a current flow in the conductor  the current flows through the rotor bars and around the end ring  producing magnetic fields around each rotor bar  in an ac circuit  the current continuously changes direction and amplitude  the resultant magnetic field of the stator and rotor continuously change  the squirrel cage rotor becomes an electromagnet with alternating north and south poles   the lower image in    fig       illustrates one instant in time during which current flow through winding a  produces a north pole  the expanding field cuts across an adjacent rotor bar  inducing a voltage  the resultant magnetic field in the rotor tooth produces a south pole  as the stator magnetic field rotates  the rotor follows       synchronous speed      the speed of the rotating magnetic field is referred to as the synchronous speed    n    s     synchronous speed is equal to     times the frequency    f     divided by the number of poles    p      rtenotitle    eq         if the frequency of the applied power supply for the two pole stator is    hz  then the synchronous speed is       rev min   rtenotitle    eq         synchronous speed decreases as the number of poles increases     table      shows the synchronous speed at    hz for different numbers of poles    file vol  page     image      png    table        the relative difference in speed between the rotor    n    and the rotating magnetic field    n    s    is called slip  there must be some slip because if the rotor and the rotating magnetic field were turning at the same speed  no relative motion would exist between the two  such that no lines of flux would be cut and no voltage would be induced in the rotor  slip is necessary to produce torque and depends on load   an increase in load will cause the rotor to slow down  ergo increase the slip  conversely  a decrease in load will cause the rotor to speed up  and so will decrease slip  slip    s    is expressed as a percentage and can be determined by   rtenot

samples to be meaningful  reservoir fluid samples themselves must be supported by accurate data to provide a unique identification and to record all important production and sampling parameters that will be used in checking the sample and  in many cases  in determining the exact measurements that will be performed  this article reviews the importance of data measurement and provides guidelines for recording and validating the necessary data      types of errors     provided that flowmeters and pressure gauges are properly sized for a measurement  so that readings are not made at the low end of the measurement range  random errors are generally small  systematic errors are a major concern  however  for all measurements  deriving from sensor malfunction  poor  or lack of  calibration  and human error in general  the latter item can include both errors in recording and reporting data and those deriving from the use of computer based acquisition systems  for example    entry of erroneous calibration data  incorrect sensor connections  software bugs  although systematic errors are comparatively rare  their magnitude can be significant  in fact  on some occasions  errors are identified only when measured values are so large that the values become ridiculous      measuring gas oil ratio accurately     the gas oil ratio  gor  is considered to be the most important measurement for separator samples  and it is dependent on errors in both the gas flow rate and the oil flow rate  which are measured separately  new techniques have seen limited application to reduce errors in gor  such as the injection of a standard marker chemical upstream of the separator and measurements of the concentrations in the separated gas and liquid streams  also  use of various carry over measurement techniques has been made  such as the isokinetic approach described briefly earlier  however  significant improvements can be achieved simply by proper sizing  calibration  and recording      measuring gas rate accurately     in production testing  gas flow rate itself is widely measured by the orifice meter  this system has been in use for a long time  but new standards have been issued more recently that improve gas rate calculations teyssandier  r g  and beaty  r        new orifice meter standards improve gas calculations  oil gas j             the orifice meter relies on a range of coefficients or factors to calculate the flow rate from the differential pressure measured across the orifice  many of these factors are derived from on site measurements of the gas  the measurement accuracy can be improved by ensuring that the orifice plate has been sized correctly for the flow so that it falls within    to     of full range  or higher  if there is no chance of going off scale   likely additional sources of error come from what could be considered mechanical factors  such as the physical condition of the orifice plate itself  waxy deposits or damage will change the flow performance and can lead to significant errors  an obvious but commonly overlooked potential error concerns not the condition of the orifice  but the recording of the orifice size  an oversight here can have serious implications not only for fluid analysis but for well test interpretation  errors in the differential pressure measurement derive primarily from poor calibration of the recording instrument or from liquid buildup in the lines that have not been purged  the orifice meter pressure base factor is a common source of errors because variations do exist between the reference pressure and temperature used for gas measurements  e g   a variation between     kpa and      psia is an increase of        thus  it is essential that reference conditions are quoted correctly  the actual source of gas gravity and supercompressibility factors    f    g   and   f    pv    is usually not important for fluid studies because accurate values are commonly calculated in the laboratory on the basis of compositional analysis of the gas sample  but it is necessary to know exactly which values were used to correct gas flow rate to the new values  to ensure the highest accuracy in gas flow rate measurement  a check should be made that all the meter factors are determined and used correctly  approximate flow rates can be derived from the choke setting  and a comparison should identify any major error in the orifice meter calculation      errors in measuring oil rate     condensate or oil flow rates are normally measured by a positive displacement meter that is placed in the outlet line from the separator upstream of the flow control valve  the most common error derives from incomplete reporting of the measurement conditions for the oil rate  especially whether the oil flow is measured at separator or at stock tank conditions  and the meter factors and shrinkage values that should be appl

the production of geothermal fluids  from regulatory and royalty payment issues to monitoring the condition of the resource and abatement of corrosive constituents in the geothermal fluid  physical and chemical measurements are a necessity for geothermal production and utilization      mass flow         single phase flow      depending on the phase being produced  the operator has a choice of many instruments for measuring flow  conventional methods are typically used to measure flow for single phase systems  the choice of flow element and meter initially depends on the mass and or volumetric flow rate  turn down ratio  range of flow to be measured   the pressure  temperature  and extent of flow surging  fluid chemistry is also a factor that can affect reliability because geothermal fluids may be very corrosive and can deposit scale or contain solids that plug the instrument and produce inaccurate measurements pe  a  j m  and campbell  h e        steam wetness measurement using a transversable retractable probe  geothermal resources council trans          differential producer type flowmeters  such as orifice  venturi  v cone  annubar and pitot tubes  are often used for steam  water and gas flow rate measurement  vortex and ultrasonic flowmeters are also sometimes used   because of the harsh conditions of geothermal production  conventional flowmeters may not maintain their calibration or even survive long in geothermal service  because a large number of wells  consisting of many single  and two phase flow streams  may produce to a power plant  a sufficient number of flowmeters is seldom installed to provide a complete mass balance on the system  in fact  many geothermal fields are produced without continuous flow rate monitoring of the wells or total fluid through the power plant  therefore  flow measurement is often necessary using portable  point by point  nondisruptive techniques   one technique for single phase vapor or brine flow measurement is a pitot tube traverse using an s type pitot tube  the measurement principle is similar to that of an annubar  but the pitot tube can be easily inserted and removed through a small valve on the pipeline  this allows measurement of flow in any straight section of pipe that has an access port at least   in         cm  in diameter  the pitot tube can traverse across the pipeline diameter to obtain high resolution velocity profiles and accurate bulk flow rate measurements  these flow measurements are made in single phase pipelines where conventional flowmeters either do not exist or require external calibration  this pitot tube is referred to an s type because of the shape of the tip  the velocity pressure tube bends into the flowstream and the static pressure tube bends downstream  this configuration results in a compact tip assembly less than   in        cm  in diameter and has the added benefit of amplifying the differential pressure reading by up to   times that of a standard pitot tube or annubar  a thermocouple sheath usually extends slightly beyond the pressure sensing tubes to protect the tubes from impact against the pipe wall and to allow for concurrent temperature measurement to temperature compensate the change in density of the fluid  the differential pressure is typically measured by a transducer with an accuracy of about           of full scale  temperature is also measured so that saturation temperature and or superheat values can be determined at each traverse point for the final volumetric and mass flow calculation  one of the most important features of a properly designed pitot tube system is the back purge capability  the pressure sensing lines must be flushed with pressurized nitrogen or air at regular intervals during the measurement process to ensure that no condensate or brine accumulates in the lines  the presence of liquid in pressure sensing lines is the most common cause for error in standard differential pressure flowmeters  another technique for nondisruptive  portable flow measurement is tracer flow testing  tft   this method was originally developed for two phase flowhirtz  p n  et al        enthalpy and mass flow rate measurements for two phase geothermal production by tracer dilution techniques  proc   eighteenth workshop on geothermal reservoir engineering  stanford university  stanford  california      but has the same applications for single phase flow as the pitot tube  the basic principle behind the tft method is to inject a conservative liquid or vapor tracer at a known rate upstream of a sample point  at the sample point  mass of tracer can be measured in the sample and calculations of flow rate can be determined  this method can be used to accurately calibrate stationary flowmeters      two phase flow      two phase fluid flow measurement by conventional mechanical devices is a more difficult problem hirtz  p

flare  or relief systems  the possibility of freezing and hydrate formation during high pressure releases to the atmosphere should be considered      design considerations     there are three main engineering considerations when designing or modifying a relief system    determining the relief requirements of individual pieces of equipment and selecting the appropriate devices to handle the imposed loads   designing a relief header system that will handle the imposed loads or expansion modifications   defining reasonable total relief loads for the combined relief header or disposal system and designing an appropriate disposal system with minimum adverse impact to personnel safety  plant process system integrity  and the environment   these considerations are interrelated in such a way that makes it impossible to establish a procedural guideline that would be valid for most cases  the design of one portion of a relief system must be considered in light of its effects on the relief system      relief device selection         determining individual relief loads      there are a number of industry codes  standards  and recommended practices that provide guidance in the

for slightly compressible liquids  with pressure replaced by pseudopressure    p    p    however  this equation is nonlinear because the product     c    t   is a strong function of pressure

inlet stream constantly flows into the separator and that the gas and liquid must be removed at the same rate      process control     for liquids  this is done by means of a level controller and level valve  the traditional level controller consists of a float on a spring  as the liquid level in the separator rises  the float rises until it closes a switch  which then opens the level valve to let out some liquid  when the level falls back down to the normal operating level  the switch opens again and drives the level valve closed  a two phase separator uses a single liquid level controller and level valve  a three phase separator will have both an oil outlet with an oil level controller and level valve and a water outlet with a water level controller and level valve   if the level valves control the liquid coming out of the separator  how is the gas controlled  because the liquid is incompressible and the liquid level in the separator remains fairly constant  the gas is contained in an approximately constant volume  as more gas enters the separator  the pressure rises  a pressure controller is mounted on the separator gas space or on the outlet gas piping  the controller sends a signal to the pressure control valve in the gas outlet piping telling it to open when the pressure is higher than the set point  pressure control valves are usually modulating  which means that they gradually open wider as the pressure rises to a value higher than the set point and close as the pressure falls to a value lower than the set point   in short  whatever amount of liquid comes into the separator  an equal amount must exit through the level control valve  the level controller senses whether the liquid level is high or low and adjusts the level valve accordingly  whatever amount of gas that comes in the inlet of the separator  an equal amount of gas must exit through the pressure control valve  the pressure controller senses pressure in the separator  opening the pressure control valve if the pressure gets higher than the desired set point and closing it if the pressure gets lower than desired  if the inlet stream shuts off  the outlet valves would all

ensure that all necessary safety equipment is in place  two levels of protection normally exist in a safety system  primary and secondary       primary protection      the primary protection is usually a sensor or switch on the equipment that detects the undesirable event  for example  equipment may have a pressure  level  or temperature switch to detect values that are too high or too low  based on the normal operating ranges  once the undesirable event is detected  a safety shutdown system is required to shut down flow into the affected equipment       secondary protection      in the event the primary protection fails to operate or operates too slowly to correct a problem  there is secondary protection consisting of a pressure safety valve  psv  to prevent overpressure  a psv is designed to open  relieving overpressure in a vessel or piping through    relief header    piping that directs the relieved fluids to a safe place for retrieval or disposal  alternatively  secondary protection may consist of redundant sensors or switches  such as those used for primary protection  which may be located on downstream equipment or on the equipment in question   a separator with a given operating pressure will have a    design    pressure or    maximum allowable working pressure     mawp  sufficiently greater than the operating pressures to prevent small fluctuations in the process from causing overpressure of the pressure vessel  as an example  in the staged separation process  the operating pressure of each downstream separator will be lower than that of the separator flowing into it  this allows the system design pressure to be reduced as well  when a higher design pressure system flows into a lower design pressure system  there is potential for overpressuring the downstream  lower pressure rated system  with multistage separators  the different operating pressures often lead to a different design p

have significant impact on the total completion efficiency      alternative methods     alternatives exist to cased  cemented  and perforated completions  openhole completions offer several options that should not be ignored in a quest for a high efficiency flow connection to the reservoir  key to the completion process is the minimization of pressure drop across the completion  specifically the

water in the drilling fluid to form acetylene  which is then detected with the tha as it circulates out  ease of handling and injection into the circulating mud system makes carbide lagging a popular choice  disadvantages include the need for a manual operation  particularly the need for an additional person on the drill floor during the busy operation of making a connection  and the requirement that there be ample free water in the drilling fluid  which is not always the case with oil based and synthetic mud systems   other materials may be injected into the drillpipe while making a

determination involves the injection of a reference gas into the mud pump intake  amen  r        quantifying hydrocarbon shows using on line gas referencing  paper hh presented at the      spwla annual logging symposium          june  reference gas injection  by its original design  serves primarily as an internal standard for quantifying mud gas concentration  a noninteracting gas is injected at low rates into the mud pump intake line  which is controlled to maintain a constant concentration of the referencing gas in the drilling fluid  momentarily increasing or decreasing the injection rate results in a subsequent increase or decrease in gas concentration in the drilling fluid  this concentration perturbation is noted while monitoring the mud gas using the logger   s gas analyzer  and its residence time in the system is used in the lag calculation  advantages of this measurement include that it can be done on demand without waiting for a connection  it is independent

the process  checkpoints indicate potential problems      overview     a kill sheet is normally used during conventional operations  it contains prerecorded data  formulas for the various calculations  and a graph   or other means   for determining the required pressures on the drillpipe as the kill mud is pumped  although many operators have complex kill sheets  only the basic required kick killing data is necessary  a kill sheet is shown in the example problem in the following section   a summary of the steps involved in proper kick killing follows  the sections not directly applicable to deepwater situations are noted  when a kick occurs  shut in the well using the appropriate shut in procedures  once the pressures have stabilized  follow these steps to kill the kick      read and record the shut in drillpipe pressure  the shut in casing pressure  and the pit gain  if a float valve is in the drillpipe  use the established procedures to obtain the shut in drillpipe pressure      check the drillpipe for trapped pressure      calculate the exact mud weight necessary to kill the well and prepare a kill sheet      mix the kill mud in the suction pit  it is not necessary to weight up the complete surface mud volume  initially  first pump some mud into the reserve pits      initiate circulation after the kill mud has been mixed  by adjusting the choke to hold the casing pressure at the shut in value  while the driller starts the mud pumps   not applicable in deep water       use the choke to adjust the pumping pressure according to the kill sheet while the driller displaces the drillpipe with the exact kill mud weight at a constant pump rate  kill rate       consider shutting down the pumps and closing the choke to record pressures when the drillpipe has been displaced with kill mud   note  if the kill mud is highly weighted up  settling and plugging may occur   the drillpipe pressure should be zero  and the casing should have pressure remaining  if the pressure on the drillpipe is not zero  execute the following steps    check for trapped pressure using the established procedures  if the drillpipe pressure is still not zero  pump an additional    to    bbl      to   m   to ensure that kill mud has reached the bit  the pump efficiency may be reduced at the low circulation rate   if pressure remains on the drillpipe  recalculate the kill mud weight  prepare a new kill sheet  and return to the first steps of this procedure      maintain the drillpipe pumping pressure and pumping rate constant to displace the annulus with the kill mud by using the choke to adjust the pressures  as necessary      shut down the pumps and close the choke after the kill mud has reached the flow line  the well should be dead  if pressure remains on the casing  continue circulation until the annulus is dead       open the annular preventers  circulate and condition the mud  and add a trip margin when the pressures on the drillpipe and casing are zero  in subsea applications  the trapped gas under the annular is circulated out by pumping down the kill line and up the choke line with the ram preventer below the annular closed  the riser must then be circulated with kill mud by reverse circulation  down the choke line and up the riser  before the preventers can be opened   well control learning experiences are often best accomplished by observing an actual

aside from their effects on porosity and permeability  this importance stems from their electrical properties  which have a great influence on the determination of fluid saturations      differences in shale formations     shales are loose  plastic  fine grained mixtures of clay sized particles or colloidal sized particles and often contain a high proportion of clay minerals  most clay minerals are structured in sheets of alumina octahedron and silica tetrahedron lattices  there is usually an excess of negative electrical charges within the clay sheets  the substitution of al    by ions of lower valence is the most common cause of this excess  the structure of the crystal remains the same  this local electrical imbalance must be compensated to maintain the electrical neutrality of the clay particle  the compensating agents are positive ions which cling to the surface of the clay sheets in a hypothetical dry state    cations  counterions  the positive surface charge is usually measured in terms of milli ions equivalents per     grams of dry clay minerals and is called the cation exchange capacity  cec   when the clay particles are immersed in water  the coulomb forces holding the positive surface ions are reduced by the dielectric properties of water  the counterions leave the clay surface and move relatively freely in a layer of water close to the surface  the electrical balance must be maintained so that the counterions remain close to the clay water interface  and contribute to the conductivity of the rock   the archie water saturation equation  which relates rock resistivity to water saturation  assumes that the formation water is the only electrically conductive material in the formation  the presence of another conductive material  i e   shale  requires either that the archie equation be modified to accommodate the existence of another conductive material  or that a new model be developed to relate rock resistivity to water saturation in shaly formations  the presence of clay also complicates the definition or concept of rock porosity  the layer of closely bound surface water on the clay particle can represent a very significant amount of porosity  however  this porosity is not available as a potential reservoir for hydrocarbons  thus  a shale or shaly formation may exhibit a high total porosity  yet a low effective porosity as a potential hydrocarbon reservoir   the way shaliness affects a log reading depends on the amount of shale and its physical properties  it may also depend on the way the shale is distributed in the formation  shaly material can be distributed in the formation in three ways    shale can exist in the form of laminae between which are layers of sand  the laminar shale does not affect the porosity or permeability of the sand streaks themselves  however  when the amount of laminar shale is increased and the amount of porous medium is correspondingly decreased  overall average effective porosity is reduced in proportion   shale can exist as grains or nodules in the formation matrix  this matrix shale is termed structural shale  it is usually considered to have properties similar to those of laminar shale and nearby massive shales   the shaly material can be dispersed throughout the sand  partially filling the intergranular interstices  the dispersed shale may be in accumulations adhering to or coating the sand grains  or it may partially fill the smaller pore channels  dispersed shale in the pores markedly reduces the permeability of the formation   all these forms of shale can  of course  occur simultaneously in the same formation      relating resistivity and saturation in shales     over the years  a large number of models relating resistivity and fluid saturations have been proposed  many have been developed assuming the shale exists in one of the three specific geometric forms  all these models are composed of a clean sand term  described by the archie water saturation equation  plus a shale term  the shale term may be fairly simple or quite complex  the shale term may be relatively independent of  or it may interact with  the clean sand term  all the models reduce to the archie water saturation equation when the fraction of shale is zero  for relatively small amounts of shaliness  most models and methods yield quite similar results   only a very few of these models will be reviewed here to provide some flavor and understanding for the evolution of shaly sand interpretation logic       laminated sand shale simplified model      in this laminar shale model    r    t    the resistivity in the direction of the bedding planes  is related to   r    sh    the resistivity of the shale laminae  and to   r    sd    the resistivity of the clean sand laminae  by a

producing intervals  thus  formation damage problems with swelling clays are not nearly as common as those associated with fines migration      impact of swelling clays     the most common swelling clays found in reservoir rock are smectites and mixed layer illites  it was earlier thought that much of the water and rate sensitivity observed in sandstones was caused by swelling clays  however  it is now well accepted that the water sensitive and rate sensitive behavior in sandstones is more commonly the result of fines migration and only rarely of swelling clays  jones jr   f o

should this happen to any extent  large reductions in permeability are observed   the presence of swelling clays is generally associated with drilling problems  i e   hole quality and stuck pipe   this can result in poor cement jobs and sensitivity to completion fluids  poor hole quality in the producing interval can result in significant migration of fluids behind pipe  resulting in reduced fluids control in the wellbore  these problems are encountered if either the producing formation or the intervening shales contain substantial quantities of swelling clays  when swelling clays are present in the producing interval  formation damage problems can occur because of rate sensitivity or water sensitivity  care must be exercised to ensure that production rates and drawdowns in such wells are maintained so that the critical velocity is not exceeded in the near wellbore region      swelling process     clay minerals  such as smectites and mixed layer illites  can expand in volume up to    times their original volume through adsorption of layers of water between their unit cells  such     clay minerals are particularly prone to swelling because there is no hydrogen bonding between the octahedral layers of the unit cells   swelling is known to occur in three steps  in the first step  referred to as crystalline swelling  layers of water enter the interlayer space in the clay mineral  resulting in an increase in the c spacing of the clay mineral in steps  the size of these steps is observed to be approximately equal to the diameter of the water molecule  extremely large swelling pressures can be generated through such an expansion of the clay lattice  the next stage in swelling is referred to as hydration swelling  this is thought to occur through the hydration and dehydration of ions entering the interlayer region  several theories have been proposed to explain the observed repulsive hydration force observed in the presence of different cations  israelachvili  j        intermolecular and surface forces  new york city  john wiley and sons _ finally  when the interlayer spacing is           or so  free swelling occurs  this is driven primarily by the balance between electrostatic and van der waals forces between the layers of clay  in this stage of swelling  the clay layers are sufficiently far apart that very little mechanical integrity exists in the clay  such clay minerals are liable to be dispersed in the flowing fluid and to plug pore throats      prevention     to prevent fines migration and clay swelling  various chemical

geologists  engineers  and managers  cumulative gas recovery  thus income  per well is limited because of low gas flow rates and low recovery efficiencies when compared to most high permeability wells  to make a marginal well into a commercial well  the engineer must increase the recovery efficiency by using optimal completion techniques and decrease the costs required to drill  complete  stimulate  and operate a tight gas well   to minimize the costs of drilling and completion  many managers want to reduce the amount of money spent to log wells and totally eliminate money spent on extras such as well testing  however  in these low permeability layered systems  the engineers and geologists often need more data than is required to analyze high permeability reservoirs  to balance the need for more data with the need to minimize costs  the logical solution is to spend money gathering accurate data on a few wells  then use correlations developed from that data to evaluate the wells that will be drilled and completed thereafter  once acceptable correlations are developed for specific reservoirs in specific geographic areas  the correlations can be applied to all wells in the area  by using these  quot calibrated quot  correlations  accurate datasets can be developed for new wells at a minimal cost   for example  if one spends          to cut cores  analyze the cores  and generate core log correlations  and these correlations can be used to plan and conduct an infill drilling plan for     wells  the cost per well to generate accurate datasets is only         normally  the most critical data items are formation permeability and in situ stress  if accurate correlations  in which logs can be used to estimate permeability and in situ stress  can be developed  the well completion and stimulation plans can be optimized      correlating core and log data     all cores from tight gas reservoirs must be properly handled and tested to obtain the accurate data required for developing useful correlations between log and core data  information concerning how to cut and test core plug samples was discussed earlier in the chapter  also  information concerning how to develop correlations for determining permeability from logs has been previously discussed  one can use    eqs       through          same as eqs    though   in permeability estimation in tight gas reservoirs  to generate accurate correlations between log data and formation permeability derived from core or well tests  these correlations can then be used to determine values of formation

subdivided by lithology  rock type or flow units prior to finalizing the correlations  if one tries to correlate the core and log data for the entire reservoir  the correlation coefficient is usually

phase separator  a free water knockout  a gun barrel  a heater treater  or other primary separation unit process  it probably includes small amounts of free or dissolved hydrocarbons and solids that

 the larger the diameter of an oil droplet  the greater its vertical velocity  that is  the bigger the droplet size  the less time it takes to rise to a collection surface and  thus  the easier it is to treat the water   the greater the difference in density between the oil droplet and the water phase  the greater the vertical velocity  that is  the lighter the crude  the easier it is to treat the water   the higher the temperature  the lower the viscosity of the water and  thus  the greater the vertical velocity  that is  it is easier to treat the water at high temperatures than at low temperatures   increasing the g force imposed on the fluid  i e   by centrifugal motion  will greatly increase the separation velocity   the third conclusion requires further elaboration  heat is the primary mechanism in oil treating equipment to remove small water droplets from oil  the addition of heat significantly reduces oil viscosity  which prompts more rapid settling  and heat destabilizes water in oil emulsions  heat is not commonly used in water treating because the percentage change in viscosity per degree of temperature change is much less in water than in oil  water in oil emulsions tend to have a higher percentage of the dispersed phase than the oil in water emulsions  the dispersed phase tends to have larger diameter droplets stabilized by heat sensitive emulsifiers  and it takes twice as much heat input to raise a barrel of water as it takes to raise a barrel of oil to the same temperature       dispersion      small oil droplets contained in the water continuous phase are subject to the competing forces of dispersion and coalescence  an oil droplet will break apart when kinetic energy input is sufficient to overcome the surface energy between the single droplet and the two smaller droplets formed from it  at the same time that this process occurs  the motion and collision of oil particles cause coalescence to take place  therefore  it should be possible to define statistically a maximum droplet size for a given energy input per unit mass and the time at which the rate of coalescence equals the rate of dispersion      eq       provides one

purposes  it could be assumed that whenever large pressure drops occur  all droplets will disperse instantaneously       coalescence      within water treatment equipment  in which the energy input to

thick walled guns      on the larger diameter  thick walled guns  there is much less distortion than on the small  thin walled through tubing guns  in wells in which clearances between the gun and tubulars are critical  the amount of distortion of the gun should be determined from the service company before the gun is used  gun body swell ranges from approximately     diameter growth in small             in  guns shot in low pressure wells to less than    diameter growth in larger guns and those shot at high pressure     fig       shows a gun swell after firing in a low pressure test  gun bowing is often noted in small guns of       in  diameter or less  whereas larger guns  because of the increased resistance to bending with increasing diameter  show no evidence of bowing    file vol  page     image      png    fig      gun swell after firing in a low pressure test           hollow carrier guns      hollow carrier guns can be run either on wireline or on tubing  they may carry large charges  which normally minimize casing damage  the carrier contains most of the debris from the charge and the alignment system  hollow carrier guns are tubes that contain the shaped charges  the guns may be of a small size  able to pass through tubing and restrictions and place initial perforations or add perforations  or of larger sizes that are run through casing  conveyed by either work strings or the production tubing  both reusable and single use guns are offered  although higher pressure and more expensive wells typically use the single use guns to minimize leaks and problems  single use guns are designed as expendables because the shaped charge perforates through the gun body  there is usually a    scallop    spot milled in the outside of the hollow carrier tube at the charge location  the scallop contains the exit burr from the charge firing  which prevents scoring of polished bores if the gun is moved after firing and may minimize gun swelling  the scallop also may minimize the metal thickness penetrated  although this affects the perforation charge performance less than      keeping the charge exit point within the scallop becomes critical when through tubing guns are used in which polished bores must be traversed with the gun after firing or when tubing clearances are critical  hollow carrier guns  depending on their diameter and design  may be loaded with   to    shots ft and have all the commonly used phase angles as well as specialty phasings        hollow carrier performance       two factors that affect the charge performance in hollow carrier perforators are standoff and gun clearance  standoff is the distance between the base of the charge and the inside of the port plug or scallop and is a fixed part of the gun charge system design  gun clearance is the distance from the outside of the port plug or scallop to the wall of the casing  the gun clearance distance for a   in  hollow carrier       phased gun in   in      lbm ft  n    casing can be anywhere from   to     in   depending on the gun position  unless centralizers are used on the gun  one edge of the gun will contact the casing wall  and maximum clearance will occur at       to the wall contact  for this reason  small guns are decentralized purposely by magnets  and the charges are all aligned to fire in the direction of the magnetic positioning      phasing   larger guns with smaller clearance distances use charges phased around the gun  typically  the maximum gun diameter selected should permit washing over the gun with washpipe in the given casing size        hollow carrier distortion       there is some distortion  swelling  in the body of almost all hollow carrier guns after firing  the amount of the distortion is a function of the size of the gun and the type and size of the charge used  the following are all factors in the gun distortion    gun diameter  gun wall thickness  charge size  shot density  shot phasing  well pressure      through tubing guns      the smaller through tubing guns should be run through a lubricator and typically are limited to approximately    ft in length  less for larger  heavier guns  the advantages of through tubing guns are low cost  the ability to perforate underbalanced  and the ability to maintain positive well control  the disadvantages of through tubing guns are limited penetration  small entry hole  and the production limitation of     phasing       expendable guns      expendable guns have charges that are exposed to well fluids and pressures  the expendable guns are popular for through tubing applications  they are more vulnerable to damage  but without the bulk of the gun body  larger charges ca

behavior      asphaltenes precipitation is caused by a number of factors including changes in pressure  temperature  and composition  the two most prevalent causes of asphaltene precipitation in the reservoir are decreasing pressure and mixing of oil with injected solvent in improved oil recovery  ior  processes  drilling  completion  acid stimulation  and hydraulic fracturing also can induce precipitation in the near wellbore region  as oil flows up the wellbore  asphaltene can precipitate as a result of pressure and temperature changes  a summary of the different field and laboratory

reservoirs that experience asphaltene precipitation usually have the following characteristics_    the fluid in place is light to medium oil with small asphaltene content   the initial reservoir pressure is much larger than the saturation pressure  that is  the fluid is highly undersaturated   maximum precipitation occurs around the saturation pressure     heavier crudes that contain a larger amount of asphaltene have very few asphaltene precipitation problems because they can dissolve more asphaltene  leontaritis and mansoori_ and kokal and sayegh_ compiled field cases with asphaltene precipitation problems during primary depletion  extreme cases include the venezuelan boscan crude with    wt  asphaltene produced nearly without precipitation  whereas the venezuelan mata acema crude

precipitation out of seawater or by biological extraction of calcium carbonate from seawater to form skeletal material  the result is sediment composed of particles with a wide range of sizes and shapes mixed together to form a multitude of depositional textures  the sediment may be bound together by encrusting organisms or  more commonly  deposited as loose sediment subject to transport by ocean currents  a basic overview of carbonate reservoir model construction was presented by lucia lucia  f j        carbonate reservoir characterization       new york  springer  and much of what is presented herein is taken from that book      depositional classification of carbonates     depositional textures are described using a classification developed by dunham dunham  r j        classification of carbonate rocks according to depositional texture  in classification of carbonate rocks   a symposium  w e  ham ed        aapg memoir no      the dunham classification divides carbonates into organically bound and loose sediments  see    fig         the loose sediment cannot be described in simple terms of grain size and sorting because shapes of carbonate grains can vary from spheroid ooids to flat concave and high spiral shells having internal pore space  the grain content of a grain supported sediment composed of shells can be as little as     of the bulk volume because the shells occupy less space than spheroids  loose sediment is  therefore  described on the basis of the concept of mud vs  grain support  mud refers to mud size carbonate particles  not to mud composed of clay minerals  grain supported textures are    grainstone  which lacks carbonate mud  packstone  which contains mud  mud supported textures are referred to as    wackestone  which contains more than     grains  mudstone  which contains less than     grains  to complete the description  generic names are modified according to grain type  such as       fusulinid wackestone        ooid grainstone      file vol  page      image      png    fig       dunham and embry and klovan classification of carbonate sediments       dunham   s boundstone class was further divided by embry and klovanembry  a j  and klovan  r e        a late devonian reef tract of northeastern banks island  n w t  bulletin of canadian petroleum geology                   because carbonate reefs are commonly composed of large reef building organisms  such as corals  sponges  and rudists  which form sediments composed of very large particles  to describe autochthonous  in place  boundstone reef material  they introduced the terms    bafflestone  bindstone  framestone  to describe allochthonous   transported  reef sediment with particles larger than   mm in diameter  the following terms are used    floatstone  rudstone  rudstone is grain supported  whereas floatstone is mud supported sediment   enos and sawatskyenos  p  and sawatsky  l h        pore networks in holocene carbonate sediments  j  of sedimentary petrology                   measured the porosity and permeability of modern carbonate sediments    the average porosity and permeability of grainstone are approximately     and    darcies  respectively   the average porosity and permeability of a wackestone are approximately     and     md  respectively   the higher porosity in mud supported sediments is caused by the needle shape of small aragonite crystals that make up the carbonate mud  and the decrease in permeability is caused by the small pore size found between mud sized particles  an important observation based on this data is that all carbonate sediments have sufficient porosity and permeability to qualify as reservoir rocks   with modifications  the dunham approach can be used to characterize the petrophysical properties of carbonate rocks  the classification must be modified  however  because diagenesis significantly alters the depositional texture  and a rock fabric classification that incorporates diagenetic overprints and that can be linked to petrophysical properties is required  the classification proposed by lucialucia  f j        rock fabric petrophysical classification of carbonate pore space for reservoir characterization  aapg bull                      is designed for this purpose  see    fig         all pore space is divided into the following classifications    interparticle  intergrain and intercrystal   vuggy  pore space within grains crystals and much larger than grains crystals   interparticle pore space is classified with the dunham classification approach  instead of grain support vs  mud support  however    grain    and   mud dominated   are used as a basic division  grain dominated fabrics include grainstone and grain dominated packstone  mud dominated fabrics include mud dominated packstone  wackestone  and mudstone  the packstone class is divided into grain  and mud dominated packstone because th

coexist at equilibrium  the term  quot vapor pressure quot  should be used only with pure compounds and is usually considered as a liquid  rather than a gas  property  for a pure compound  there is only one vapor pressure at any temperature  this page discusses calculation of vapor pressure from other properties      vapor pressure temperature chart     a plot of vapor pressures for various

of integration that depends on the particular fluid and the data range  this equation suggests that a plot of logarithm of vapor pressure against the reciprocal of the absolute temperature would approximate a straight line  such a plot is useful in interpolating and extrapolating data over short ranges  however  the shape of this relationship for a real substance over a significant temperature range is more s shaped than straight  therefore  the use of the clausius clapeyron equation is not recommended when other methods are available  except over short temperature ranges in regions where the ideal gas law is valid      cox chart     coxcox  e r        pressure temperature chart for hydrocarbon vapors  ind  eng  chem                    further improved the method of estimating vapor pressure by plotting the logarithm of vapor pressure against an arbitrary temperature scale  the vapor pressure temperature plot forms a straight line  at least for the reference compound  and usually for most of the materials related to the reference compound   this is especially true for petroleum hydrocarbons  a cox chart  using water as a reference material  is shown in    fig        in addition to forming nearly straight lines  compounds of the same family appear to converge on a single point  thus  it is necessary to know only vapor pressure at one temperature to estimate the position of the vapor pressure line  this approach is very useful and can be much better than the clapeyron method  its accuracy is dependent to a large degree on the readability of the

and increase profitability through the design and deployment of integrated workflows  digital oilfield workflows combine business process management with advanced information technology and engineering expertise to streamline and  in many cases  automate the execution of tasks performed by cross functional teams      overview     the term  quot digital oilfield quot  has been used to describe a wide variety of activities  and its definitions have encompassed an equally wide variety of tools  tasks  and disciplines  all of them attempt to describe various uses of advanced software and data analysis techniques to improve the profitability of oil  amp  gas production operations  frequently recurring digital oilfield themes include   but are not limited to    operational efficiency  production optimization  collaboration  decision support  data integration  workflow automation  one way to understand the rise of digital oilfield technology is by considering some of the unprecedented challenges currently being faced by the oil and gas industry    bimodal age distribution of workforce   quot crew change quot    proliferation of software applications and data formats  global distribution of work teams  instant availability of massive amounts of real time data  steadily decreasing number and size of new discoveries  growing expense of advanced recovery technologies  if one maps the challenges onto the themes  it becomes clear that digital oilfields are attempting to compensate for a higher complexity and cost of operations which must be performed by fewer  less experienced employees  to achieve this  digital oilfields must either subsume or accelerate many of the tasks and processes traditionally performed by engineers  geoscientists  field technicians  financial analysts  and even managers  the industry has come to refer to ordered  related collections of such tasks as workflows  and industry professionals increasingly think in terms of workflow design   the design of workflows and processes is a discipline that historically has most often been practiced by industrial engineers or operations management specialists  the language of oil  amp  gas production has changed to reflect the adoption of their techniques  traditional segmentations of responsibilities among functional lines  e g  reservoir  completion  and production engineers  are being integrated into engineering workflows and business processes that more broadly reflect the corporate objectives to be achieved  e g  reservoir surveillance  well test validation  production

grown out of initiatives which started in earnest around the turn of the century  however  one of the earliest targets for workflow orchestration was the integrated modeling of flow through a pressure

in service to maximize the service utility of the tube while minimizing fatigue failures  as a result  three commonly used methodologies for predicting the fatigue condition of the ct were developed      running feet method     a relatively simplistic approach used to predict the working life of coil tubing is commonly described as the    running feet    method  in which the footage of tubing deployed into a wellbore is recorded for each job performed  this deployed footage is then added to the existing record of footage deployed in service for any given string  depending upon the service environment  type of commonly performed services  and local field history  the ct string is retired when the total number of running feet reaches a predetermined amount   the running feet method offers the service vendor relative simplicity of use  requiring only that the maximum depth of ct deployed into the wellbore be recorded  however  there are numerous limitations of this fatigue tracking method as a reliable means of determining ultimate working life of a ct service string  several limitations are described next   the value of maximum footage to retirement for any ct string is based on the service vendor   s previous experience with the same type of tubing  performing wellsite operations with similar well depths and types of service  in this method  there is generally no consideration given to duration of corrosive services performed or effects of exposure to atmospheric corrosion    the running feet method typically focuses on the specified outside diameter  od  of the ct string in service  with minimal consideration for tubing wall thickness  tube material type  and yield strength   the running feet method does not have a means of accounting for variations in tubing guide arch radius  service reel core radius  internal pressure loading  or identification of specific tube segments where additional bending cycles are applied   the working life derating method used in the running feet approach cannot be extended to different tubing sizes or operating conditions  this method can be used only where working history for the specific tube material  geometry  and surface handling equipment has been gathered and analyzed to yield the prescribed maximum running feet value      trip or empirical method     a natural extension of the running feet fatigue derating approach can be found in what is commonly described as the    trip    method  in the trip method  numerous improvements have been incorporated to the running feet approach  providing greater reliability in predicting working life of the ct string   one major improvement entails evaluating the ct string as a series of partitioned segment lengths that can range from     to     ft long  this approach applies a greater sensitivity to the working life analysis by identifying sections of the ct that are subjected to more bending cycles than others during a specified service  the number of trips over the service reel and tubing guide arch for each discrete segment can then be tracked and recorded  when employing this method  a reduction in the length of the section increment increases the accuracy of the bend cycle record  this type of analysis makes it possible to identify the ct string segments that have experienced the most bend cycle fatigue damage   another major improvement with the trip method incorporates the effects of internal pressure loading  for a given tubing guide arch and service reel core radius  ct bend cycle fatigue life decreases significantly with increased internal pressure loading  the evolution of the trip method incorporated extensive ct bend cycle fatigue testing using full scale service equipment  injector  tubing guide arch  and service reel  and varying amounts of internal pressure loading  in this scenario  numerous bend cycle fatigue tests are performed for a given size of ct at specified amounts of internal pressure   data recorded in these tests were initially used to create a database for statistical projection of ct working life  from these types of tests  a segment of the ct string that had accumulated a considerable amount of bend cycle fatigue damage can be identified  thereby providing the user with options for removing the heavily damaged segment of tubing from service   as more full scale fatigue cycle tests were performed  trends in ct fatigue were identified for various pipe sizes  tube geometry  and internal pressure load conditions  analysis of these trends provided the service vendor with the ability to    curve fit    the data points and derive empirical coefficients that were incorporated into conventional multiaxial fatigue life prediction approaches  yielding the early ct fatigue prediction models   the aforementioned improvements in fatigue damage tracking realized by the trip method offer enhanced account

transient flow solutions in the laplace transform domain  for example  in the laplace transform domain  duhamel   s theorem_ provides a convenient means of developing transient flow solutions for variable rate production problems using the solutions for the corresponding constant rate production problem      transient flow solutions in the laplace domain     duhamel   s theorem states that if     p   and     p    c   denote the pressure drawdown corresponding to the variable production rate    q     t     and the constant production rate    q    c    respectively  then  rtenotitle                         applying the laplace transform converts the convolution integral in    eq       to an algebraic expression  and duhamel   s theorem is given in the laplace transform domain as  rtenotitle                         the simplicity of the expression given in    eq       explains our interest in obtaining transient flow solutions in the laplace transform domain   another example to explain the convenience of the laplace domain solutions is for the naturally fractured reservoirs  common transient flow models of naturally fractured reservoirs lead to the following differential equation in radial coordinates in the laplace transform domain  _  rtenotitle                         where the subscript   f   indicates the fracture property  and   t    d   and   r    d   are the

the model chosen to represent the naturally fractured reservoir _ the corresponding differential equation for a homogeneous reservoir is obtained by setting   f        s        and is given by  rtenotitle                         the general solutions for    eqs       and         are given  respectively  by  rtenotitle                        and  rtenotitle                         to obtain a

demonstrates that it is possible to derive transient flow solutions for naturally fractured reservoirs by following the same lines as those for the homogeneous reservoirs  furthermore  if the solution for the corresponding homogeneous reservoir system is known in the laplace transform domain  then the solution for the naturally fractured reservoir problem may be directly obtained from    eq         obtaining the laplace transforms of the green   s and source function solutions developed in the time domain with the methods explained on the source function solutions of the diffusion equation and solving unsteady flow problems with green s and source functions pages usually poses a difficult problem  the problems arise mainly because of the use of the product method solution  for a specific class of functions  chen   et al   _ presented a technique that may be used to apply the laplace transform to the product solution technique  for a more general procedure to develop source function

permeability  high productivity  clastic reservoirs is their propensity to produce significant amounts of formation solids  while sand can be a problem for most downhole equipment  it can compromise the ability of intelligent well equipment to do its job  erosion of choke elements  seal surfaces  control lines  and interference with device movement can render the intelligent completion inoperable  thus losing its functionality and the ability of the operator to use the equipment to realize its long term value   sand control techniques have been applied in these environments with varying degrees of success  and it is safe to say that a properly conceived and executed sand control strategy can be very effective in reducing or eliminating solid production without unduly restricting productivity  new techniques  such as expandable screens  have been added to tried and true techniques such as gravel packs  but combining sand control technology with intelligent well technology can be a significant challenge  particularly when producing fluid from multiple  unconsolidated  high productivity zones  the intelligent completion industry is attacking this challenge in concert with the sand control industry to generate innovative integrated solutions that bring maximum value to the customer      issues specific to intelligent wells     the challenge to the completions industry is how to effectively integrate intelligent well technologies with modern sand control strategies  the following issues must be considered when using intelligent flow control and monitoring in a sand producing environment       protection and isolation of zones or layers      intelligent well completions may be used to    monitor and control flow from separate reservoirs  separate layers  separate regions of a heterogeneous formation  some or all of these zones may require some form of sand control  but the hydraulic isolation of one zone from the other is critical to the effectiveness of the flow control  isolation may be achieved by using cemented and perforated liners with blank sections between zones  openhole completions with screens or gravel packs may require blank sections of liner with inflatable external casing packers and multistage gravel packing equipment       equipment diameters and available space      intelligent flow control equipment  transducer mandrels  and flatpacks or control lines all take significantly more space than conventional completion equipment and may need to be deployed directly inside the sand control equipment  this can create conflicts when attempting to keep casing and completion equipment sizes within conventional designs while maximizing flow areas to reduce flow velocity and maximize productivity       fluid velocity  pressure drop  and erosion      the bane of completion equipment in a solids producing environment is erosion  and restricted flow areas and tortuous flow paths  typical around and through flow control equipment  contribute to the effects of high velocity causing equipment erosion  when producing compressible fluids  such as gas  the flowing pressure drop associated with high velocity and restricted flow areas result not only in lower productivity but also in higher flow velocity  if the producing environment is corrosive  erosion corrosion mechanisms must also be considered in the material selection for the completion       protection of sensors  cables  and control lines      control lines  cables  and sensors represent the nervous and circulatory system of an intelligent well completion  and damage to these elements may mean partial or total loss of the functionality of the intelligent completion  these elements must be adequately protected from erosion  or the potential thereof from sand control failure   vibration  and thermal stresses by use of appropriately designed clamps and encapsulating blast joints  some manufacturers provide systems using dual redundant control line and electronic systems capable of operating on one system in the event of failure of the other       mechanical interference of moving components      the solids produced with the fluids can interfere with movement and sealing of dynamic components  particularly sleeves on flow control chokes and valves  the design of these components must be sand tolerant   either they must exclude solids from entering cavities that may cause interference with movement  or they must be able to easily wipe away the solids or function despite the presence of solids  actuators and spring returns must generate sufficient force to move the dynamic components despite buildup of solids or scale  frequent cycling of the valves may prevent accumulation of significant amounts of solid but may also cause more wear and tear on seals and bearing surfaces       injection wells      in multizone reservoirs where the production wells require

determine permeability with the methods outlined in api   rp      api rp     recommended practices for core analysis  second edition        washington  dc  api  all other techniques are calibrated back to core measurements  however  because core measurements sample such a minute part of the reservoir  we must rely on techniques that can be applied in a widespread fashion across the reservoir  these methods rely on measurements on sidewall samples  correlation to wireline logging responses  interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance  nmr  logs  wireline formation tester pressure responses  and drillstem tests      measurement approaches         sidewall samples      this technique is valid for slightly to unconsolidated sandstone rock types  carbonate rock types are generally too heterogeneous for small samples to provide any meaningful reservoir wide value for permeability  sidewall samples of sandstone rock types are inherently contaminated with drilling mud particles and are of little use for direct measurement of permeability  however  we can inspect the rock sample with a binocular microscope to estimate median grain size  sorting  and degree of consolidation  and to characterize pore fills  with these data  we can develop correlations to permeability on the basis of whole core measurements  an alternative is to disaggregate the sample and determine a grain size analysis with laser light scattering  which can then be correlated to permeability on the basis of whole core analysis       wireline logging correlations      permeabilities measured in cores can be correlated to wireline measurements taken in the cored borehole  at various times and places  almost every wireline log has been used to correlate to permeability  the porosity permeability crossplot is  perhaps  the most used  however  it is subject to considerable error  in select basins  the gr log response can be used to correlate to permeability while  in other basins  the neutron log or acoustic log seems to provide the correlation with least statistical scatter       nmr logs      interpretation of nmr logging responses provides a volumetric distribution of pore sizes  if the pores are assumed to be spherical in shape  a value for permeability can be computed  these size dependent data have been coupled with nmr pore volumes and nmr fluid saturations to produce an nmr permeability log  the chapter on nmr logging in this section of the handbook shows examples of these techniques       wireline formation testers      all wireline tester vendors provide answer products that take the drawdown and buildup pressure vs  time responses and compute mobility  mobility can be converted into permeability if a value of fluid viscosity is assumed  this permeability must be used with some caution  first  the pressure measurements are made on the borehole wall that has suffered possible drilling damage and pore throat plugging from mud solids  second  one must take note if the measurement is in an invaded zone with two phases and  hence  the permeability determined is an effective permeability  not an absolute permeability  depending on rock type and fluid saturations  the effective permeability may be an order of magnitude too small  the chapter on fluid sampling in the general engineering section of this   handbook   presents examples of wireline formation tester responses and derived permeability and the use of these pressure measurements to determine fluid gradients       drillstem tests      see discussions in acquiring bottomhole pressure and temperature data and formation testing while drilling  ftwd      determining permeability     point by point permeability values are needed over the reservoir interval at the wellbores for several purposes  first  the distribution and variation of the permeabilities are needed by the engineers to develop completion strategies  second  this same information is needed as input to the geocellular model and dynamic flow calculations  e g   numerical reservoir simulation models   for both of these  the first consideration is the location of shales and other low permeability layers that can act as barriers or baffles to vertical flow  a second consideration is the nature of the permeability variation  i e   whether the high permeability rock intervals occur in specific layers and the low permeability intervals occur in other layers  or that there is so much heterogeneity that the high  and low permeability intervals are intimately interbedded with each other    when good quality core data are not available  estimates of permeability can be made from empirical equations  permeability is controlled by such factors as pore size and pore throat geometry  as well as porosity  to take

receive those waves  the appropriate energy source and receiver depend on the location and the application  this article describes different types of equipment used for seismic data acquisition      impulsive sources     a variety of seismic sources exist that can apply vertical impulse forces to the surface of the ground  these devices are viable energy sources for onshore seismic work  included in this source category are gravity driven weight droppers and other devices that use explosive gases or compressed air to drive a heavy pad vertically downward  dobrin and others dobrin  m b

onshore seismic surveys but are prohibited at some sites because of environmental conditions  cultural restrictions  or federal and state regulations  chemical explosives are no longer used as marine energy sources for environmental and ecological reasons   field tests should always be made before an extensive seismic program is implemented  first  it should be determined whether the selected impulsive source creates adequate energy input to provide data with an appropriate signal to noise ratio and a satisfactory signal bandwidth at appropriate offset distances  second  it is important to determine whether an impulsive source causes unwanted reverberations in shallow strata      vibrators     vibroseis    energy sources are some of the more popular seismic source options for onshore hydrocarbon exploration  the generic term vibrator refers to these types of seismic sources  vibrators have several features that make them attractive for seismic data acquisition  they are quite mobile and allow efficient and expeditious illumination of subsurface targets from many different shotpoint locations  also  the frequency content of a vibrator signal often can be adjusted to better meet resolution requirements needed for a particular target  in addition  the magnitude of the energy input into the earth can be tailored for optimal signal to noise conditions by varying the size and number of vibrators or by altering the output drive of individual vibrators  for these reasons  vibrators are one of the most versatile onshore seismic energy sources       operation      vibrators work on the principle of introducing a user specified band of frequencies  known as the sweep  into the earth and then crosscorrelating that sweep function with the recorded data to define reflection events  the parameters of a vibrator sweep are    start frequency  stop frequency  sweep rate  sweep length       start and stop frequency       a vibrator can do an upsweep that starts with a frequency as low as   to    hz and stops at a high value of          or     hz  alternatively  vibrators can do a downsweep that starts with a high frequency and finishes with a low frequency  most vibroseis data are generated with upsweeps        sweep rate       sweep rate can be linear or nonlinear  a linear rate causes the vibrator to dwell for the same length of time at each frequency component  nonlinear sweeps are used to emphasize higher frequencies because the vibrator dwells longer at higher frequencies than it does at lower frequencies        sweep length       sweep length defines the amount of time required for the vibrator to transverse the frequency range between the start and stop frequencies  as sweep length is increased  more energy is put into the earth because the vibrator dwells longer at each frequency component  sweep length is usually in the range of   to    seconds   if a vibrator sweep is    seconds long  then each reflection event also spans    seconds in the raw  uncorrelated data  it is not possible to interpret uncorrelated vibroseis data because all reflection events overlay each other and individual reflections cannot be recognized  the data are reduced to an interpretable form by a crosscorrelation of the known input sweep with the raw data recorded at the receiver stations  each time the correlation process finds a replication of the input sweep  it produces a compact symmetrical correlation wavelet centered on the long reflection event  in this correlated form  vibroseis data exhibit a high signal to noise ratio  and reflection events are robust wavelets spanning only a few tens of milliseconds       signal noise ratio optimization      as a general observation  if an area is plagued by random noise  vibrators are an excellent energy source because the correlation process used to reduce the vibrator sweep to an interpretable form disc

and sodium lignosulfonate   three grades of lignosulfonate are available for the retardation of cement slurries  each grade is available as calcium sodium or sodium salts  the three grades are    filtered  purified  modified       filtered       the filtered grade calcium or sodium salt is typically used at a temperature of      f bhct or less at a concentration of      bwoc or less  it may be used at higher temperatures but will normally be limited by economic considerations        purified       the purified grade represents a class of lignosulfonates in which the sugar content has been reduced  the calcium sodium salt is typically used at a bhct of      f or lower and at a concentration of      bwoc or less        modified       the modified grade represents lignosulfonates that have been blended or reacted with a second component  the compounds most commonly used as blend components are boric acid and the hydroxycarboxylic acids  or their salts  blended materials are available as calcium or sodium salts  the modified lignosulfonates are typically used at a bhct of      f or above  they are more effective than the purified grade at temperatures greater than      f  the advantages  whether a blend or reacted product  are their improved high temperature stability above      f bhct  increased dispersing activity  and synergism with fluid loss additives       cellulose derivatives      two cellulose polymers are used in well cementing applications  they are hydroxyethyl cellulose  hec  and carboxymethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose  cmhec   hec is commonly considered as a fluid loss additive  although as a possible option  it is worth noting that at bhct of      f or less  the thickening time can be extended by approximately two hours in a freshwater slurry  traditionally  the only cellulose that is considered as a retarder is cmhec  this is largely because it is functional as a retarder up to approximately      f bhct at the same concentrations as calcium lignosulfonate  but it also provides good fluid loss control       hydroxycarboxylic acids      the hydroxycarboxylic acids are well known for their antioxidant and sequestering properties that benefit cement slurry performance  the antioxidant property improves the temperature stability of soluble compounds such as fluid loss additives  commonly used hydroxycarboxylic acids and their derivatives are    citric acid  tartaric acid  gluconic acid  glucoheptonate  glucono delta lactone  the commonly used hydroxycarboxylic acids are generally derived from naturally occurring sugars       organophosphates      organophosphonates  with a few exceptions  are the most powerful retarders used in cement  these materials are not widely used in well cementing applications because of the low concentration required  difficulty of accurate measurement  and sensitivity to concentration  the advantage of organophosphate retarders is their effectiveness in ultrahigh temperature wells   gt       f  or in applications where extended thickening times of    hours or greater are desired       synthetic retarders      the term synthetic retarder is a misnomer in that the previously mentioned retarding compounds are all  in effect  man made  however  the term synthetic retarder has been applied to a family of low molecular weight copolymers  these retarders are based on the same function groups as those of conventional retarders  e g   sulfonate  carboxylic acid  or an aromatic compound   two common synthetic retarders are    maleic anhydride    acrylamido   methylpropanesulfonic acid  amps  copolymers       inorganic compounds      the retardation mechanism of inorganic compounds on cement hydration is different from that for the previously discussed retarders  inorganic compounds  commonly used as cement retarders  are borax  na b o      h   and other borates such as boric acid  h bo   and its sodium salt and zinc oxide  zno    borates are commonly used as a retarder aid for high temperature retarders at bhct of      f       c  and greater  at higher temperatures  the borate is a less powerf

a natural tendency for a liquid liquid system to separate and reduce its interfacial area and  hence  its interfacial energy  however  most emulsions demonstrate kinetic stability  i e   they are stable over a period of time   produced oilfield emulsions are classified on the basis of their degree of kinetic stability     loose emulsions separate in a few minutes  and the separated water is free water    medium emulsions separate in tens of minutes     tight emulsions separate  sometimes only partially  in hours or even days     stabilizing mechanisms   water in oil emulsions are considered to be special liquid in liquid colloidal dispersions  their kinetic stability is a consequence of small droplet size and the presence of an interfacial film around water droplets and is caused by stabilizing agents  or emulsifiers   these stabilizers suppress the mechanisms involved that would otherwise break down an emulsion  such mechanisms include     sedimentation   aggregation or flocculation   coalescence   phase inversion  sedimentation is the falling of water droplets from an emulsion because of the density difference between the oil and water  aggregation or flocculation is the grouping together of water droplets in an emulsion without a change in surface area  coalescence is the fusion of droplets to form larger drops with reduced total surface area  oil demulsification discusses the mechanisms of emulsion breakup        surface films and stability to coalescence      produced oilfield emulsions are stabilized by films that form around the water droplets at the oil water interface  these films are believed to result from the adsorption of high molecular weight polar molecules that are interfacially active  surfactant like behavior   these films enhance the stability of an emulsion by increasing the interfacial viscosity  highly viscous interfacial films retard the rate of oil film drainage during the coalescence of the water droplets by providing a mechanical barrier to coalescence  which can lead to a reduction in the rate of emulsion breakdown     figs    and      show the persistent film in a water in oil emulsion  the presence of fine solids can also strengthen the interfacial film and further stabilize emulsions     file vol  page     image      png    fig        photomicrograph of an emulsion showing interfacial films      file vol  page     image      png    fig        photomicrograph of an emulsion showing interfacial films  magnified        the properties of interfacial films depend on      type of crude oil  asphaltic  paraffinic  etc      composition and ph of the water    temperature    extent to which the adsorbed film is compressed    contact or aging time    concentration of polar molecules in the crude oil   a good correlation exists between the presence of incompressible interfacial film and emulsion stability  these films are classified into two categories on the basis of their mobilities      rigid or solid films are like an insoluble  solid skin on water droplets characterized by very high interfacial viscosity  there is considerable evidence that very fine solids stabilize these films  they provide a structural barrier to droplet coalescence and increase emulsion stability  these films also have viscoelastic properties      mobile or liquid films are characterized by low interfacial viscosities  liquid films are formed  for example  when a demulsifier is added to an emulsion  they are inherently less stable than rigid or solid films  and coalescence of water droplets is enhanced    emulsion stability has been correlated with the mobility of interfacial films  surfactants that modify the rigidity of the film can affect demulsification considerably      factors affecting oil emulsion stability    since interfacial films are primarily responsible for emulsion stability  it is important to understand factors that affect interfacial films  important factors are      heavy polar fractions in the crude oil   solids  including organic  asphaltenes  waxes  and inorganic  clays  scales  corrosion products  etc   materials   temperature   droplet size and droplet size distribution   ph of the brine  and brine composition     heavy polar fraction in crude oil     naturally occurring emulsifiers are concentrated in the higher boiling polar fraction of the crude oil  these include      asphaltenes   resins   oil soluble organic acids  e g   naphthenic  carboxylic  and bases  these compounds are the main constituents of the interfacial films surrounding the water droplets that give emulsions their stability        asphaltenes          fig       shows that asphaltenes are complex polyaromatic molecules defined to be soluble in benzene ethyl acetate and insoluble in low molecular weight n alkanes  they are dark brown to black friable solids with no definite melting point  asphaltenes are

empirical  used to analyze deliverability tests in terms of pseudopressure  the four most common types of gas well deliverability tests are discussed in separate articles  flow after flow  single point  isochronal  and modified isochronal tests      types and purposes of deliverability tests     deliverability testing refers to the testing of a gas well to measure its production capabilities under specific conditions of reservoir and bottomhole flowing pressures  bhfps   a common productivity indicator obtained from these tests is the absolute open flow  aof  potential  the aof is the maximum rate at which a well could flow against a theoretical atmospheric backpressure at the sandface  although in practice the well cannot produce at this rate  regulatory agencies sometimes use the aof to allocate allowable production among wells or to set maximum production rates for individual wells   another application of deliverability testing is to generate a reservoir inflow performance relationship  ipr  or gas backpressure curve  the ipr curve describes the relationship between surface production rate and bhfp for a specific value of reservoir pressure  that is  either the original pressure or the current average value   the ipr curve can be used to evaluate gas well current deliverability potential under a variety of surface conditions  such as production against a fixed backpressure  in addition  the ipr can be used to forecast future production at any stage in the reservoir   s life   several deliverability testing methods have been developed for gas wells  flow after flow tests are conducted by producing the well at a series of different stabilized flow rates and measuring the stabilized bhp  each flow rate is established in succession without an intermediate shut in period  a single point test is conducted by flowing the well at a single rate until the bhfp is stabilized  this type of test was developed to overcome the limitation of long testing times required to reach stabilization at each rate in the flow after flow test   isochronal and modified isochronal tests were developed to shorten tests times for wells that need long times to stabilize  an isochronal test consists of a series of single point tests usually conducted by alternately producing at a slowly declining sandface rate without pressure stabilization and then shutting in and allowing the well to build to the average reservoir pressure before the next flow period  the modified isochronal test is conducted similarly  except the flow periods are of equal duration and the shut in periods are of equal duration  but not necessarily the same as the flow periods       theory of deliverability test analysis     the theoretical equations developed by houpeurthoupeurt  a        on the flow of gases in porous media  revue de l   lnstitut francais du petrole                are exact solutions to the generalized radial flow diffusivity equation  while

developed empirically  all basic equations presented here assume radial flow in a homogeneous  isotropic reservoir and therefore may not be applicable to the analysis of deliverability tests from reservoirs with heterogeneities  such as natural fractures or layered pay zones  these equations should not be used to analyze tests from hydraulically fractured wells during the fracture dominated linear or bilinear flow periods  finally  these equations assume that wellbore storage effects have ceased  unfortunately  wellbore storage distortion may affect the entire test period in short tests

nine decades with many economically successful projects  nevertheless  it is regarded as a high risk process by many primarily because of the many failures of early field tests  most of those failures came from the application of a good process  isc  to the wrong reservoirs or the poorest prospects  an objective of this chapter is to clarify the potential of isc as an economically viable oil recovery technique for a variety of reservoirs  this chapter is a summary containing a description of isc  a discussion of laboratory screening techniques  an illustration of how to apply laboratory results to field design  a review of performance prediction methods  a discussion of operational practices and problems  and an analysis of field results  for a more complete review  the work of

description     isc is basically injection of an oxidizing gas  air or oxygen enriched air  to generate heat by burning a portion of resident oil  most of the oil is driven toward the producers by a combination of gasdrive  from the combustion gases   steam  and waterdrive  this process is also called fire flooding to describe the movement of a burning front inside the reservoir  based on the respective directions of front propagation and air flow  the process can be forward  when the combustion front advances in the same direction as the air flow  or reverse  when the front moves against the air flow        reverse combustion      this process has been studied extensively in laboratories and tried in the field  the idea is that it could be a useful way to produce very heavy oils with high viscosity  in brief  it has not been successful economically for two major reasons first  combustion started at the producer results in hot produced fluids that often contain unreacted oxygen  these conditions require special  high cost tubulars to protect against high temperatures and corrosion  more oxygen is required to propagate the front compared to forward combustion  thus increasing the major cost of operating an isc project second  unreacted  coke like heavy ends will remain in the burned portion of the reservoir  at some time in the process  the coke will start to burn  and the process will revert to forward combustion with considerable heat generation but little oil production  this has occurred even in carefully controlled laboratory experiments in summary  reverse combustion has been found difficult to apply and economically unattractive       forward combustion      because only forward combustion is practiced in the field  we will only consider this case  forward combustion can be further characterized as  quot dry quot  when only air or enriched air is injected or  quot wet quot  when air and water are coinjected      dry combustion      the first step in dry forward isc is to ignite the oil  in some cases  autoignition occurs when air injection begins if the reservoir temperature is fairly high and the oil is reasonably reactive  this often occurs in california reservoirs  ignition has been induced with downhole gas burners  electrical heaters  and or injection of pyrophoric agents or steam injection  it will be discussed in more detail later after ignition  the combustion front is propagated by a continuous flow of air  rather than an underground fire  the front is propagated as a glow similar to the hot zone of a burning cigarette or hot coals in a barbecue  as the front progresses into the reservoir  several zones exist between injector and producer as a result of heat  mass transport  and chemical reactions     fig         wu

important to development of a geomechanical model before drilling  some major geomechanical rock properties are described below      deformation of rocks     elasticity     to first order  most rocks obey the laws of linear elasticity  that is  for small strains  the elements of the stress and strain tensors are related through  rtenotitle  where  rtenotitle                         in other words  the stress required to cause a given strain  or normalized length change    lk  ll   is linearly related to the magnitude of the deformation and proportional to the stiffnesses  or moduli   mijkl  furthermore  the strain response occurs instantaneously as soon as the stress is applied  and it is reversible   that is  after removal of a load  the material will be in the same state as it was before the load was applied  a plot of stress vs  strain for a laboratory experiment conducted on rock that obeys such a law is a straight line with slope equal to the modulus  however  in real rocks  the moduli increase as a function of effective stress  particularly at low stress  some of this increase is reversible  nonlinear elasticity   but some of it is irreversible  plasticity or end cap compaction   to make matters even more complicated  rocks also exhibit time dependent behavior  so that an instantaneous stress change elicits both an instantaneous and a time dependent response  these anelastic effects can be seen in laboratory experiments  as shown in    fig       moos  d  and chang  c        relationships between porosity  pressure  and velocities in unconsolidated sands  proc   overpressure in petroleum exploration workshop  pau  france    file devol      final page     image      png    fig      this figure shows the loading path and the confining pressure as a

samples of an upper miocene turbidite  as in most experiments of this type  a cylindrical rock sample is jacketed with an impermeable soft sleeve and placed in a fluid filled pressure cell  the fluid pressure surrounding the sample is increased slowly  and the fluid pressure  confining stress  and sample axial and circumferential strains are measured  to identify the various deformation processes that occur in this unconsolidated sand  the stress is slowly increased at a constant rate and then held constant until the sample stops deforming  then the pressure is decreased to approximately half of the previous maximum pressure  after that  the pressure is increased at the same rate until the next pressure step is completed  this process continues until the desired maximum pressure is achieved  and then the sample is slowly unloaded and removed from the pressure cell       stress strain curve      all aspects of typical rock behavior can be seen in the stress strain curve plotted on the bottom of    fig        at low pressure  the sample is soft  and there is a rapid increase of stiffness with pressure  nonlinear elasticity  owing to crack closure  as well as an increase in stiffness caused by irreversible compaction  once the pressure increase stops  the sample continues to deform  with deformation rate decreasing with time  time dependent creep   the sample is stiffer during unloading than during loading  and during this phase of the experiment  it essentially behaves as a linear elastic material  the permanent strains during loading and creep that occurred through plastic viscous deformation mechanisms are not recoverable  reloading follows the  purely elastic  unloading path until the maximum previous pressure has been reached  after which additional plastic deformation begins to occur again as the material resumes following the compaction curve  all of these effects can be seen in situ  including the difference between the loading and unloading response   measurements of p wave and s wave velocity made on this sample during the experiment by measuring the time of flight of pulses transmitted axially along the sample were used to calculate the dynamic

to increase oil production is known as  quot secondary recovery quot  and typically follows  quot primary production  quot  which uses the reservoir   s natural energy  fluid and rock expansion  solution gas drive  gravity drainage  and aquifer influx  to produce oil      rationale for waterflooding     the principal reason for waterflooding an oil reservoir is to increase the oil production rate and  ultimately  the oil recovery  this is accomplished by  quot voidage replacement quot    injection of water to increase the reservoir pressure to its initial level and maintain it near that pressure  the water displaces oil from the pore spaces  but the efficiency of such displacement depends on many factors  e g   oil viscosity and rock characteristics   in oil fields such as wilmington

water or brine frequently was produced from a well along with oil  and as the oil production rate declined  the water production rate often would increase  this water typically was disposed of by dumping it into nearby streams or rivers  in the     s  the practice began of reinjecting the produced water into porous and permeable subsurface formations  including the reservoir interval from which the oil and water originally had come  by the     s  reinjection of produced water had become a common oilfield practice   reinjection of water was first done systematically in the bradford oil

and common practice developed in the u s  between      and       by the mid     s  the onshore us oil industry was maturing and primary production from many of its reservoirs had declined significantly  whereas most reservoirs elsewhere in the world were in the early stages of primary production  also  in the u s   thousands of wells had been drilled that were closely spaced  so that the effects of water injection were more obvious and so were more quickly understandable   in addition to the need to dispose of saline water that was produced along with the oil  several other factors made waterflooding a logical and economical method for increasing recovery from oil fields  very early on  it was recognized that in most reservoirs  only a small percentage of the original oil in place  ooip  was being recovered during the primary production period because of depletion of the reservoirs    natural energy  additional recovery methods were needed to produce the large quantity of oil that remained  water injection   s early success in lengthening the oil production period by years made waterflooding the natural step after primary production to recover additional oil from reservoirs whose oil production rate had declined to very low levels   other key factors that drove waterflooding   s development and increasing use were    water is inexpensive  water generally is readily available in large quantities from nearby streams  rivers  or oceans  or from wells drilled into shallower or deeper subsurface aquifers  water injection effectively made production wells that were near the water injection wells flow or be pumped at higher rates because of the increased reservoir pressure  concurrently  the scientific reasons behind waterflooding   s

been made using formation imaging tools   in accumulations with a severe loss of circulation  operators typically stop drilling at the top of the reservoir section  a practice that  while necessary for safe operations  precludes characterization of the objective section   well performance frequently is strongly influenced by proximity to major fractures  which can extend surprising distances  because of this  be extremely cautious in assigning reserves to undrilled tracts that offset tracts at a mature stage of production   although transient pressure analysis provides useful data  applying modern interpretation techniques mandates using highly accurate quartz pressure transducers   the accuracy of type curve matching depends on the accuracy of the mathematical model used for the type curves  an invalid model cannot yield a valid interpretation  even if the model is valid  analysis of results might not provide unique answers   in pressure depletion reservoirs  the rate

effective displacement of oil by gas injection in a preferentially oil wet  low dip reservoir  j pet technol                     spe      pa   over the decades  a considerable number of immiscible gas injection projects have been undertaken  some with excellent results and others with poor performance  reasons for this range of performance are discussed in this chapter  at the end of this chapter  a variety of case studies are presented that briefly describe several of the successful immiscible gas injection projects gas injection projects are undertaken when and where there is a readily available supply of gas  this gas supply typically comes from produced solution gas or gas cap gas  gas produced from a deeper gas filled reservoir  or gas from a relatively close gas field  such projects take a variety of forms  including the following    reinjection of produced gas into existing gas caps overlying producing oil columns   injection into oil reservoirs of separated produced gas for pressure maintenance  for gas storage  or as required by government regulations   gas injection to prevent migration of oil into a gas cap because of a natural waterdrive  downdip water injection  or both   gas injection to increase recoveries from reservoirs containing volatile  high shrinkage oils and into gas cap reservoirs containing retrograde gas condensate   gas injection into very undersaturated oil reservoirs for the purpose of swelling the oil and hence increasing oil recovery     the primary physical mechanisms that occur as a result of gas injection are     partial or complete maintenance of reservoir pressure      displacement of oil by gas both horizontally and vertically      vaporization of the liquid hydrocarbon components from the oil column and possibly from the gas cap if retrograde condensation has occurred or if the original gas cap contains a relict oil saturation  and     swelling of the oil if the oil at original reservoir conditions was very undersaturated with gas  gas injection is particularly effective in high relief reservoirs where the process is called  quot gravity drainage quot  because the vertical gravity aspects increase the efficiency of the process and enhance recovery of updip oil residing above the uppermost oil zone perforations the decision to apply immiscible gas injection is based on a combination of technical and economic factors  deferral of gas sales is a significant economic deterrent for many potential gas injection projects if an outlet for immediate gas sales is available  nevertheless  a variety of opportunities still exist  first are those reservoirs with characteristics and conditions particularly conducive to gas oil gravity drainage and where attendant high oil recoveries are possible  second are those reservoirs where decreased depletion time resulting from lower reservoir oil viscosity and gas saturation in the vicinity of producing wells is more attractive economically than alternative recovery methods that have higher ultimate recovery potential but at higher costs  and third are reservoirs where recovery considerations are augmented by gas storage considerations and hence gas sales may be delayed for several years nonhydrocarbon gases such as co  and nitrogen can and have been used kuehm  h g        hawkins inert gas plant  design and early operation  presented

communication with aquifers  as pressure decreases during pressure depletion  the compressed waters within the aquifers expand and overflow into the petroleum reservoir  the invading water helps drive the oil to the producing wells  leading to improved oil recoveries  like gas reinjection and gas cap expansion  water influx also acts to mitigate the pressure decline  the degree to which water influx improves oil recovery depends on the size of the adjoining aquifer  the degree of communication between the aquifer and petroleum reservoir  and ultimately the amount of water that encroaches into the reservoir      overview     some of the most prolific oil fields in the world are waterdrive reservoirs  perhaps the most celebrated example is the east texas field  the final oil recovery in the east texas field is projected to be approximately     roadifer  r e        size distributions of world   s largest known oil  tar accumulations  oil  amp  gas j      february       as this example shows  water influx has the potential to improve oil recovery considerably   once a water influx mechanism has been identified  it is important to monitor the producing wells closely and to minimize water production  minimizing water production in    edgewater drives    may require systematically shutting in flank wells once the advancing water reaches them  minimizing water production in    bottomwater drives    may require systematically cementing in lower perforations as the bottom water slowly rises   an integral part of reservoir surveillance for waterdrives is an active assessment program  the first phase of assessment includes diagnosis  classification  and characterization  the second phase identifies mathematical models that effectively simulate the aquifer  especially its deliverability  this phase includes reliably estimating aquifer model parameters  the third and final phase includes combining aquifer and reservoir models into a common model that can be used to forecast future recovery effectively and to identify optimal depletion strategies  the success of the third phase depends heavily on the success of the preceding two phases      waterdrive and aquifer classification     waterdrives are classified in several ways  first  they are classified according to the location of the aquifer relative to the reservoir    peripheral waterdrive    the aquifer areally encircles the reservoir  either partially or wholly   edgewater drive    the aquifer exclusively feeds one side or flank of the reservoir  bottomwater drive    the aquifer underlays the reservoir and feeds it from beneath  waterdrives also are classified according to the aquifer   s strength and to how well the aquifer delivers recharge water to the reservoir  the aquifer strength also refers to how well the aquifer mitigates the reservoir   s normal pressure decline  a strong aquifer refers to one in which the water influx rate approaches the reservoir   s fluid withdrawal rate at reservoir conditions  these reservoirs also are called complete waterdrives and are characterized by minimal pressure decline  strong aquifers are generally very large in size and highly conductive  a moderate or weak aquifer is one in which the water recharge rate is appreciably less than the reservoir   s fluid withdrawal rate  these reservoirs are called partial waterdrives and they are characterized by pressure declines greater than a complete waterdrive but less than a volumetric reservoir  an aquifer   s weakness is related directly to its lack in size or conductivity      waterdrive diagnosis     there are several diagnostic indicators to help identify or discount a possible active aquifer   first  an understanding of the reservoir   s geology is important  the entire outer surface of the reservoir must be scrutinized carefully to identify communicating and noncommunicating pathways  communicating pathways represent possible water entry points  geological maps should be consulted to identify the type of reservoir trap and the trapping surfaces  trapping surfaces represent impenetrable surfaces and are discounted automatically as possible water entry points  the remaining outer surfaces need to be evaluated and classified  if no communicating pathways exist  then the reservoir can be confidently discounted as a possible waterdrive  however  if communicating pathways exist  then the reservoir remains a candidate waterdrive   second  and perhaps most importantly  the water cut history of all producing wells should be recorded and regularly monitored  a steady rise in a well   s water cut is a good indicator of an active aquifer  although this is among the best indicators  it is not foolproof  for instance  an increasing water cut might be caused by water coning instead of an active waterdrive  special precautions need to be exercised to avoid water coning  a rising water

inverse lever rule because it is equivalent to a statement concerning the distances along a tie line from the overall composition to the liquid and vapor compositions  thus  the amount of liquid is proportional to the distance from the overall composition to the vapor composition  divided by the length of the tie line   rtenotitle                            eq       is another lever rule similar to that described for binary diagrams  the liquid and vapor portions of the binodal curve meet at the plait point  a critical point at which the liquid and vapor phases are identical  thus  the plait point mixture has a critical temperature and pressure equal to the conditions for which the diagram is plotted  depending on the pressure  temperature  and components  a plait point may or may not be present    file vol  page     image      png    fig        ternary representation of phase diagrams          fig   a    is a phase diagram for the liquid liquid equilibrium behavior typical of mixtures of brines of low salinity with oil  if there is no surfactant present  the oil and brine are immiscible  mixture compositions on the base of the diagram split into essentially  quot pure quot  brine in equilibrium with  quot pure quot  oil  the addition of surfactant causes some oil to be solubilized into a microemulsion rich in brine  that phase is in equilibrium with a phase containing nearly pure oil  thus  in the low salinity brine  the surfactant partitions into the brine phase  solubilizing some oil  the plait point in fig   a lies close to the oil corner of the diagram  because only two phases occur and the tie lines all have negative slope  such phase is often called type ii      phase diagrams for high salinity brines are often similar to    fig   b     in the high salinity systems  the surfactant partitions into the oil phase and solubilizes water into an oil external microemulsion  in this case  the plait point is close to the brine apex on the ternary diagram  for intermediate salinities  the phase behavior can be more complex  as    fig   c    shows  a triangular three phase region occurs  see    fig           for which the phases are    a brine rich phase  an oil rich phase  a microemulsion phase  there is a two phase region adjacent to each of the sides of the three phase triangle  in    fig   c     the two phase region at low surfactant concentrations is too small to show on the diagram  it must be present  however  because oil and brine form only two phases in the absence of surfactant       gas injection processes      miscible displacement processes are designed to eliminate interfaces between the oil and the displacing phase  thereby removing the effects of capillary forces between the injected fluid and the oil  unfortunately  fluids that are strictly miscible with oil are too expensive for general use  instead  fluids such as c

an oil recovery flooding operation and the uniformity vertically and areally of the flood front as it is being propagated through an oil reservoir  this page provides an overview of selected chemical systems and technologies that promote improved conformance during oil recovery operations  see conformance problems for a discussion of the underlying problems creating the need for conformance improvement      overview     conformance improvement systems and technologies include fluid systems for use during oil recovery flooding operations in which the fluids promote sweep improvement and mobility control  e g   polymer waterflooding  and oilfield conformance improvement treatment systems  e g      small volume    gel treatments   a conformance improvement fluid system for promoting flood sweep improvement and mobility control involves injecting a volume of an oil recovery fluid that constitutes a significant fraction of the reservoir pore volume  the volume of an oil recovery flooding system that is applied for sweep improvement is usually greater than    of the reservoir and or well pattern pore volume  conformance improvement treatment systems normally are of a relatively small volume and usually are used to treat the near wellbore region or a relatively small fracture volume within the reservoir   if there were perfect conformance in a perfect regular five spot well pattern during an oil recovery flooding operation  the flood front would reach all four of the offset producers at the same time  and the flood front would reach the entire vertical interval of all four of the producing wells at the same time  of course  there never has been a reservoir that has exhibited perfect conformance during an oil recovery flooding operation  the issues that must be considered are how imperfect is the conformance for a given flooding operation in an oil field  and what is the economic or other beneficial rate of return if a conformance improvement flood or treatment is implemented   improved conformance during an oil recovery operation will result in incremental and or accelerated oil production and or will result in reduced oil production operating costs  properly designed and executed conformance improvement flooding or treatments will improve the effectiveness  efficiency  and profitability of an oil recovery operation  regardless of whether the oil recovery operation is primary production  secondary waterflooding  or tertiary mode flooding   as originally and purely defined  conformance improvement flooding operations and treatments involve improving the uniformity of the flood front of an injected drive fluid during an oil recovery flooding operation  in addition to the original definition  the working definition of conformance improvement treatments now includes treatments applied to production wells to shut off excessive  deleterious  and competing co production of water or gas coming from a source other than the producing oil formation interval  examples of such co production are the coning of water from an underlying aquifer and the coning of gas from an overlying gas cap  thus  using this expanded working definition of conformance improvement treatments  conformance treatments can include water or gas shutoff treatments that are applied to production wells during primary oil recovery operations  see conformance problems kabirkabir  a h        chemical water and gas shutoff technology   an overview  presented at the spe asia pacific improved oil recovery conference  kuala lumpur        october  spe       ms   presents a high level overview of the use of polymers  gels  foams  and resins as water and gas shutoff treatments   the vast majority of conformance improvement treatments function by reducing the permeability and fluid flow capacity of the offending and treated reservoir high permeability flow paths  channels  and conduits  see also disproportionate permeability reduction      enhancing sweep efficiency     improving conformance  in its original and most limited definition  is synonymous with improving the drive fluid sweep efficiency during an oil recovery flooding operation  improving the conformance and or sweep efficiency for any given oil recovery drive fluid during a reservoir flooding operation involves improving one  or both  of two components of flood sweep efficiency

some problems have the potential for serious consequences such as injury to personnel  pollution of the environment  and loss of company assets  understanding  preventing  or minimizing potential negative consequences requires a fundamental understanding of basic protection concepts and safety analysis   this page summarizes the basic protection concepts required for the safe design and operation of a production facility  it begins by developing a hazard tree for a generic production facility and then illustrates how hazards analysis can be used to identify  evaluate  and mitigate

testing of basic surface safety systems for offshore production platforms        washington  dc  api      basic protection concepts     most threats to safety from production involve the release of hydrocarbons  therefore  the analysis and design of a production facility safety system should focus on preventing such releases  stopping the flow of hydrocarbons to a leak if it occurs  and minimizing the effects of hydrocarbons should they be released       prevention      ideally  hydrocarbon releases should never occur  every process component is protected with two levels of protection  primary and secondary  the reason for two levels of protection is that if the first level fails to function properly  a secondary level of protection is available       shut in      if hydrocarbon releases occur  and  in spite of our best efforts  they sometimes do   inflow to the release site must be shut off as soon as possible  the problem should not be exacerbated with the continued release of additional hydrocarbons  protective shut in action is achieved by both the surface safety system  sss  and the emergency support system  ess   shut in systems are discussed in more detail in recommended methods for safety analysis       minimizing      when hydrocarbons are released  their effects should be minimized as much as possible  this can be accomplished through the use of ignition prevention measures and emergency support systems  esss   i e   the liquid containment system   if oil spills from a process component  a release of hydrocarbons has occurred  a spill is never good  but component skids and deck drains  if offshore  minimize the effect of a bad situation when the spill would otherwise go into a freshwater stream or offshore waters      hazard tree     a hazard tree    identifies potential hazards  determines the conditions necessary for a hazard to exist  determines sources that could create this condition  breaks the chain leading to the hazard by eliminating the conditions and sources  because complete elimination is normally not possible  the goal is to reduce the likelihood of occurrence  with statistical analysis  the probability of occurrence can be determined  the effect of a safety procedure or device that reduces the probability of a condition or source occurring also can be quantified with this tool   a hazard tree is somewhat subjective in that different evaluators may classify conditions and sources differently or they may carry the analysis to further levels of sources  the hazard tree helps the investigator focus attention on all of the aspects to be considered  no matter how the tree is formulated  conclusions reached concerning the design  maintenance  traffic patterns  lighting  etc   should be similar       general production facility hazard tree      api   rp   j  api rp   j  design and hazards analysis for offshore production facilities        washington  dc  api  shows a hazard tree for

pollution derives from an oil spill that can be caused by one of the conditions shown in the hazard tree  if an oil spill were to occur  pollution could be avoided by installing adequate containment  requirements for tank dikes  drip pans  offshore   and sumps reduce the probability of oil pollution from most small spills        fire explosion       an oil spill or gas leak can provide fuel for a

face of uncertainty  the probabilistic approach in this page defines two types of uncertainty that are associated with small scale inherent variability  commonly is associated with relatively small  meters length  scales     types of uncertainty associated with small scale inherent variability   the two types of uncertainty associated with small scale inherent variability discussed are measurement error and small scale geologic variability    for both types of uncertainty  it is assumed that there is an underlying population that exactly defines the system of interest  as examples of small scale inherent variability  the proportion of ripple drift lamination  geologic variability  at any location is a fixed constant  whereas the proportion within the reservoir is those constant values integrated over the entire reservoir volume  likewise  the degree of variability in this ratio across all possible locations can be calculated  the data from all possible locations can be assembled into a cumulative frequency distribution  this rarely is accomplished  but when it is  the results are termed a    census    and the knowledge of the population of interest is considered exhaustive    in the absence of a census  frequency distributions can be approximated using mathematical formulae  each distribution is completely definable in terms of a few constants  parameters   a gaussian distribution  for instance  is completely defined by two parameters  population mean    m    and standard deviation       varying one or the other will produce a family of gaussian distributions that vary in location on the real number line and in range       measurement error    the first type is referred to as measurement error  it is irreducible and generally cannot be perfectly explained  for example  in terms of reservoir geology  it could be the small scale randomness that is inherent in the reservoir  such as the product of the nonlinear processes of deposition and erosion  for example  the probability of finding a sediment bundle containing one depositional microstructure is simply the ratio of the volume of that microstructure to the volume of the reservoir  if this ratio does not vary systematically across the reservoir  then the volume of the depositional microstructure   say  ripple laminated sandstone   can be predicted  albeit with the same type of uncertainty as is associated with a coin toss  that is  given a probability of      the volume represented by this microfacies would be expected to be     times the local volume of the reservoir  however  we expect the real volume to vary within the limits of our probabilistic estimate  at any point in the reservoir  the random depositional processes will permit the true volume to vary within limits tied to our probability model      small scale geologic variability    the second type of uncertainty is the small scale geologic variability  and it stems from an incomplete sampling of reservoir topology   this can lead to an incomplete knowledge of the connectivity of flow units  the problem here is related to the nature of the flow paths  e g   the connectivity of permeable and impermeable elements within the reservoir   it is not sufficient to know the probability that a permeable bed will occur in a borehole  nor is it enough to know the bed   s average thickness  we also need to predict the existence and location of    choke points     permeability restrictions or barriers within the flow paths  these choke points constitute infinitesimal reservoir volume and seldom are documented by borehole data or seismic procedures  yet  they can be critical to understanding flow because they connect local or even regional barriers  we know of their existence from well tests and pressure data and from our knowledge of outcrop or field analogs     estimating parameters from a sample   most statistical practice seeks to determine the parameters of a distribution without the cost and effort of a census  and does so by estimating the parameters on the basis of a relatively small set of carefully collected observations  valid sample   an unbiased sample will produce an unbiased estimate of the population parameters  however  it cannot be known with certainty whether any set of sample parameters is identical to the values of the population parameters  additionally  a collection of such estimates  i e   statistics  from repeated sampling will be centered on the values of the parameters  the spread of values around the parametric value commonly is an inverse function of the number of observations in a sample    not all frequency distributions are gaussian  and the functions that generate estimates of their parameters therefore are different  the gaussian distribution is special for several reasons  though  first  it is the distribution generated as the product of a simple nonlinear process

the practical application of production logging technology       tables explanation     for a given problem  the reader is guided first in the selection of the set of logging tools most appropriate  next  suggestions are given on the proper procedure for each tool   s use  this is an important part of the guidance  because the way logging records are obtained is often the most important part of the operation  finally  the user is provided with comments regarding what the records should show relative to the problem  recognition of expected results is equally important because irrelevant features on a log can easily prevent its proper interpretation  the tables are independent of the preceding body of the text and presume that the user lacks detailed knowledge of the subject   the tables are unique to the literature in their ability to provide the user with detailed guidance without the investment of extensive search time  this feature is a consequence of the indexing approach to the information in the tables  the first level in the classification system is the nature of the well and the type of completion in which the tools are to be run  this environmental factor is called the   well category    the tools that are best for one type of completion may be completely inappropriate for another type  for a given   well category    the second level is the type of problem of interest to the user  this level is called   problem type    its identification leads to the final or third level in the classification   namely  to a table of tools appropriate to the specific well category and problem type  this final table provides the information listed above  such an approach leads to much duplication of material  but is the one most beneficial to the user  available publications attempt the classification on the basis of problem type alone  but this approach leads to so many disclaimers  quot for this situation and for that situation quot  that the result is confusion rather than guidance      function and utilization of tables     to make use of the application tables  one enters the compilation sequentially through two indexing tables  identified as    table a        well category   and    table a        problem type    having selected a category number from    table a      level     the user than locates this number in    table a      level     where a listing of general problem types is associated with each category number  each problem type is identified by its index number  made up of a category number followed by a capital letter  for example  the designation  a identifies a well still being drilled  well category  but experiencing problems of pipe sticking  pipe manipulation  or cross sectional constriction  problem type   having selected an index number from    table a      the reader next locates the third level table having this number letter designation  this final table subdivides the general problem into more specific problems  where appropriate  and provides a listing of recommended logging tools along with suggestions concerning their proper use and comments on what one should expect to see in the records from each tool  the tools are listed in the order of their likelihood to resolve the reasons for a particular problem  consequently  tool exclusion for a particular job should start at the bottom of the list and work upward    file vol  page      image      png    table a      file vol  page      image      png    table a       the well category     table a      cannot include all possible combinations of tubing placement relative to casing  the user may therefore not find a single category that describes completely an unusual completion  instead  the completion may have at certain locations features common to one particular listing  whereas  at other locations  the features may coincide with a different listing  in such a case  the user will need to digest the contents of several tool selection tables to devise a tool string appropriate to the completion   a general comment is in order relative to tool selection  slickline or downhole memory logging tools have evolved to the point that multiple traces can be recorded on a single pass  this gives the ability to record traces from depth control sensors  such as a collar locator and a gamma ray tool  simultaneously with traces from production logging sensors  the previously limited quality in depth control has therefore been eliminated  furthermore  sample rates can be set sufficiently high  up to   samples per second  so that the tools produce traces with a quality equal to that from electric line surveys  in fact  the newer sensors on slickline strings often provide better traces  a corresponding improvement in surface interrogation and processing hardware now makes it possible to prepare a log from a slickline string within a few hours af

chemistry  physics  and biomedicine and  more recently  in clinical diagnosis for imaging the internal structure of the human body  the same physical principles involved in clinical imaging also apply to imaging any fluid saturated porous media  including reservoir rocks  the petroleum industry quickly adapted this technology to petrophysical laboratory research and subsequently developed downhole logging tools for in situ reservoir evaluation      purpose of nmr logging     nmr logging  a subcategory of electromagnetic logging  measures the induced magnet moment of hydrogen nuclei  protons  contained within the fluid filled pore space of porous media  reservoir rocks   unlike conventional logging measurements  e g   acoustic  density  neutron  and resistivity   which respond to both the rock matrix and fluid properties and are strongly dependent on mineralogy  nmr logging measurements respond to the presence of hydrogen protons  because these protons primarily occur in pore fluids  nmr effectively responds to the volume  composition  viscosity  and distribution of these fluids  for example    oil  gas  water  nmr logs provide information about the quantities of fluids present  the properties of these fluids  and the sizes of the pores containing these fluids  from this information  it is possible to infer or estimate     fig          the volume  porosity  and distribution  permeability  of the rock pore space  rock composition  type and quantity of fluid hydrocarbons  hydrocarbon producibility   file vol  page      image      png    fig       nmr logging tool response compared to conventional logging tools  nmr porosity is independent of matrix minerals  and the total response is very sensitive to fluid properties  differences in relaxation times and or fluid diffusivity allow nmr data to be used to differentiate clay bound water  capillary bound water  movable water  gas  light oil  and viscous oils  nmr log data also provide information concerning pore size  permeability  hydrocarbon properties  vugs  fractures  and grain size       nmr logging provides measurements of a variety of critical rock and fluid properties in varying reservoir conditions  e g   salinity  lithology  and texture   some of which are unavailable using conventional logging methods     fig       and without requiring radioactive sources     table        whether run
